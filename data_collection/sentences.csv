NAME
" Your sensitive nature causes you to lack self-confidence, and to withdraw from arguments or turmoil, as any discord reflects quickly through your nervous system.  You cannot stand pressure and desire to work where there is no confusion.  This name restricts proper verbal expression; as a result, you are often lonely, craving understanding of others.  Yours is a very deep, reflective nature, but others would never know it as you keep your deeper feelings within."
" This name stimulates urges and desires for which there is no creative outlet and the ensuing frustration creates nervous tension which centres in the region of the solar plexus and intestinal organs.  You feel emotional frustrations and disturbances that create irritability and a strong temper.
"
 This name does not offer the softness of expression for long-lasting compatibility in close associations.
""
"You are quite healthy, but possible trouble areas are found in the generative organs.
"
" You find the beauties of nature, fine music, art, and literature--all the deeper things of life--inspiring.  The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding."
"You are likely a big eater, requiring heavy foods to satisfy your appetite.  Overeating can affect the bloodstream, causing it to become overheated.  In turn, skin problems could result.  There could also be weaknesses in the generative organs."
" Your sociable nature expresses affection, kindness, and thoughtfulness to the extent that it is difficult for you not to be affected by others and governed by your emotions, rather than by logic and reason.  As you respond to love and encouragement from others, your romantic and dreamy nature can easily lead you into love affairs.  Your desire for peace at any price can result in going out of your way to avoid arguments and confrontation or hurting the feelings of others.  Also, budgeting can be a problem as you enjoy spending money and can easily ignore being practical."
" Although you desire to avoid monotony, you seem to be attuned to system, order, and attention to detail.  You can be very analytical, exacting, and patient as long as there is a challenge holding your interest, such as in the field of computers with its technical challenge.  When your interest is exhausted, you switch to something else even though it means leaving your undertakings unfinished.  This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  This skepticism has not protected you from many disappointments when people you have trusted have let you down."
" You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
" You could be musically or artistically inclined and may often be the ""life"" of the party and would enjoy finding expression in the entertainment field.  You have a pleasure-loving nature, and although you have an ability to meet and mix with people on all levels, you tend to become involved in awkward emotional situations to your detriment.  Deriving pleasure from giving to others, you enjoy spending money on them, but tend to be a spendthrift, and not build up a reserve for emergencies."
"Weaknesses in the health could affect the kidneys, or lower back."
" You believe in speaking directly and to the point, so you are candid and abrupt.  Many friendships are lost because of your directness.  Those in close association complain that you are not inclined to observe and return acts of kindness, compassion, or affection.  You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
" You do enjoy an argument and will at times say things just to get others going and then you sit back and enjoy the debate.  You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money.  This name creates a nature that can be the life of the party, but many times you can become involved in emotional situations against your better judgment.  Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to."
" Because of your efficiency you attract a great deal of responsibility, and you are inclined to worry excessively and become too involved in details out of proportion to their importance.  You resist change until you have examined an idea in detail and all facts fall into place for you.  You can be deliberate to a fault.  Your over-cautious nature allows many promising opportunities to slip by.  Conserving finances and material possessions, you maintain your home at a good standard, and treat all family responsibility seriously.  Though reserved in showing affection you are a considerate person."
" You are one to make your own decisions, and not be influenced by others.  You desire independence and freedom from the authority and interference of others.  You are not overly ambitious, preferring instead just to seek stable, settled conditions which are adequate to meet your responsibilities.  In your personal relations with others, you are inclined to be rather serious, and not to see the humour others see, or to respond spontaneously.  Your positive manner and outlook can make others feel that you are imposing your will on them and even interfering in their affairs."
" In the business world, your reserve and outward placidity command respect for your authority.  However, in your personal life, this reserve and reticence are often mistaken for coldness and lack of feeling, with the result that others find it difficult to understand you.  While your name gives you a clever, deep mind, you feel and sense much that you do not fully understand. As it is not easy for you to share your deeper thoughts and ideals with others, you are inclined to choose the association of those few friends with whom you feel the most at ease and with whom you can enjoy companionship in a contemplative mood without feeling pressure for verbal communication."
" Those in close association complain that you are not inclined to observe and return acts of kindness, compassion, or affection.  You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
" However, in the attempt to impress others with the scope of your success, you can over-extend your resources to the point that you have inadequate means to cover your basic expenses.  There are times when you would be advised to start in a smaller way, and gradually reach your desired level of success through perseverance, patience, and attention to details.  When things are going well, you have a generous, magnanimous nature, ready to offer support and assistance to others.  When under stress, you can become overbearing and belittling in your attitude to others, and inclined to express sarcasm and temper.  Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own world of personal relationships or material possessions, you could suffer disappointments with those close to you, unfulfilled ideals, or material losses."
" Your appreciation of art and music is focused around how to make these activities into viable financial opportunities.  At times, you create misunderstandings with others as it is not easy for you to be diplomatic."
 You tend to be lavish in your tastes and to spend your money freely.  You have a heart of gold and are always ready to give generously.
" An intellectual, you have a deep appreciation for art, music, literature, and all the phenomena of nature.  You express your thoughts and feelings best through writing rather than verbally.  In fact, others find it challenging to understand you as you do not reveal your innermost thoughts unless you are completely comfortable in your friendships.  For that reason, despite having good business abilities, you like to work alone or where you are making your own decisions.  It has created separateness from others and loneliness in your life."
" This name restricts spontaneity in association and the fluency of your verbal expression.  When you are required to express yourself in personal matters requiring finesse and diplomacy, you feel awkward and embarrassed.  Although you realize perfectly well what is expected of you, you are unable to find the right words, and hence you end up saying something inappropriate in a candid way.  You can express your deeper thoughts and feelings best through writing.  Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.  You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
" You prefer to limit your friendships and associations to those who share your interests and appreciate your quiet, refined ways.  Others often find it difficult to understand you.  Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" You also have a tendency to worry.  It causes you to be too serious, and interferes with happiness and relaxation that comes with naturalness of expression."
"Weakness in the health could centre in the female functions, or skin conditions could be troublesome.
"
"The intensity of your nature would cause you to suffer in the senses of the head, as well as with digestive problems.  You also would have a sensitivity in your solar plexus.  In extreme cases, mental turmoil, major stomach operations, and accidents of a serious nature could occur."
" In your personal relations with others, you are inclined to be rather serious, and not to see the humour others see, or to respond spontaneously.  Your positive manner and outlook can make others feel that you are imposing your will on them and even interfering in their affairs."
" Your empathy for the problems of others in social or economic issues, could bring satisfaction from work of a humanitarian nature.  You find it easy to converse with all types of people.  Your desire to possess and direct those closest to you could result in shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships."
" As you are a private person, it is a challenge for others to get to know and understand you. Your reticence has caused you to suffer aloneness and misunderstandings.  You would like to be easy-going and spontaneous but it does not come easily.  You can express yourself better through writing than verbally.  The mysteries of life appeal to you in your search for an understanding of the greater picture of life.  You love to read and can develop great powers of concentration."
" That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
Weaknesses in the health through stress and tension could affect the intestinal tract and related difficulties or could cause prostate problems.
 You tend to be dominated by lyour habits and dislike changing a pattern of living that is comfortable to you.  You have a traditional and conservative outlook in almost everything.
 Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets.
"Over-indulgence in heavy foods could cause stomach or intestinal disorders; these foods would also cause your body to be heavy, sluggish and overweight."
" Obstacles to your progress or restrictions on your freedom to act create a sense of frustration which may cause you to feel resentful and even rebellious.  You can then become intolerant of others, and caustic and belittling in your expression, thereby imposing stress on your personal relationships.  Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents.  Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts."
" Your home and family are important to you.  You have the ability to be an excellent homemaker and mother, or a teacher, as you appreciate people and know how to make them feel at ease, but you are inclined to worry over your responsibilities.  You enjoy a daily routine and settled conditions, once you have found a comfortable niche in life.  You resist changes until you have examined an idea in detail and until all facts fall into place.  If you have to make a change, it is not easy to do so happily.  You do not readily change your ideas unless you are thoroughly convinced that you must."
A craving for sweet foods could cause skin conditions or liver problems.  You would find it difficult to control your desires and could over-indulge in your pleasures.
" This name could allow expression along musical and artistic lines and gives you the desire to entertain and to meet and mix with people of refinement and culture.  It also brings out your love of home and family, and in close association you are able to show understanding and affection.  Others are attracted by your generosity and your consideration of their interests.  Although this name is well balanced, if it is combined with a surname that is not harmonious, you would tend to worry and find it difficult to organize your efforts."
"You have high goals and ideals, but must incorporate more practicality, system, and concentration in order to materialize them."
 The mysteries of life appeal to you in your search for an understanding of the greater picture of life.  You love to read and can develop great powers of concentration.
" Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" Having definite ideas, you are skeptical and do not change easily, for you require proof, preferably in complete detail before you will alter an opinion.  Once you are settled into a situation, you do not like to move or make changes.  When on a schedule, you follow it implicitly. Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
" Procrastination is a weakness of your nature, causing an inability always to complete your plans or to concentrate for long.  You need to see a concept presented completely in detail before you can understand it, and if you cannot understand it, you come to your own conclusion and often fail to listen to and reason out another's point of view.  You resist being forced into change and could become almost impervious to new ideas.  You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood."
" Always budgeting carefully, you do not believe in frivolous spending.  You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but you are not especially imaginative or investigative.  You are particular and quite set in your way you want things to be done.  Once you have made up your mind or formed an opinion it is not easily changed.  Hence there is a restriction in friendships and business opportunities."
"
The influence of this name can be harmful to your health and personal happiness, even though it may take you far in business.  You frequently experience nervous tension in the solar plexus.  A sensitive stomach and ulcers could result.  Also, ailments could centre in the head affecting the eyes, ears, nose, throat, or teeth."
" Your personal appearance is important to you, for you desire to make a good impression on others.  Your pleasant manner attracts people to you with their problems and you are capable of offering practical advice, though you would probably not follow such advice yourself.  This name causes you to be somewhat too concerned with the personalities, problems, and activities of other people.  You seem positive and decisive and can be outspoken in the expression of your opinions, but you lack the self-confidence needed to follow through with your ideas and plans.  Procrastination is your downfall.  You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition."
" Since you are impressionable and receptive, you feel the misfortunes of others very keenly.  However, this name makes it awkward for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings with finesse and diplomacy to the extent that your candid, sometimes blunt, manner of speaking creates misunderstandings with others.  Being somewhat self-centred, you learn through your own experiences, as you rarely take advice from others.  Yet, you are sensitive and very easily hurt and offended.  You long for praise and appreciation for your efforts, but others find it difficult to understand you.  You dislike monotony and system and enjoy being creative in an inventive way whether it be in interior decorating, music, art, crafts, or other endeavours that require versatility and skill.  You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
" This name spoils patience and depth of thought, and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence."
" The qualities of this name would find a more constructive outlet in work that involves high-pressure selling or promotional activities, possibly in community affairs, for it contains a positive, driving power.  It is difficult for you to merge with others; although you have quickness of mind, you lack tolerance and can give way to impatience at another's slowness or shortcomings.  If you cannot complete your plans when you wish to do so, you could suffer intense moods of depression and extreme sensitivity in the region of the solar plexus, resulting possibly in ulcers or nervous disorders.  This name could take you into bitter experiences through impulsive action."
"Often feeling burdened with work, you worry about details out of proportion to their importance.  Having definite ideas, you are skeptical and do not change easily, for you require proof, preferably in complete detail before you will alter an opinion.  Once you are settled into a situation, you do not like to move or make changes.  When on a schedule, you follow it implicitly. Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
" Your expressive, affectionate nature responds quickly through your feelings, but you must guard against being possessive and jealous.  Your delight in mystery and your sensitivity to things you do not understand could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, it is difficult for you to retain emotional stability, for you can easily swing into moods of depression and self-pity.  Your quick temper can flare up suddenly and be over as suddenly, leaving you very sorry for any suffering you have caused."
" This name creates much frustration, nervous tension, and personal unhappiness because you are not able to realize your ambitions and ideals.  You desire your life to be orderly and systematized and you keep your surroundings neat and tidy, but others often see you as fussy over little things.  You are a patient person and you will work hard one step at a time to accomplish your endeavours.  You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but are not inclined to pursue inspirational or creative expression as in music or the arts.  As you have modest ambitions, you are content to live from day to day and to save for your future.  You budget carefully and do not believe in frivolous spending.  You appreciate a settled home environment that permits you to show your love for friends and family through what you do for them rather than having to express your feelings in words.  Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail."
"Any weakness in the health would affect the fluid functions, and you could suffer through kidney trouble or female problems.
"
" In order to gain greater congeniality in your personal associations, you need to cultivate a more relaxed manner, greater generosity, understanding, and tolerance, and, above all, you need to avoid being too outspoken and self-opinionated."
" Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  Your emotional nature at times does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, and you experience entanglements that could prove awkward and embarrassing."
" On the other hand, among friends with whom you feel at ease, you are expressive, witty, and quite charming.  These contrasting natures make it difficult for people to understand you and can lead to friction in your personal life.  You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed and self-pitying over any real or imagined slight.  If you are not careful, people take advantage of your generous nature.  You find the beauties of nature, fine music, art, and literature--all the deeper things of life--inspiring.  The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding."
 You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods.
" This name restricts congenial expression and association, creating much aloneness.  You could express your thoughts more easily in writing than in speaking.  You seldom experience the peace of mind that comes with composed thinking and emotional control."
" In your desire to gain the favour of others and to keep peace, because you abhor friction, you change your opinion to agree with those at hand.  It is easy for you to express love and affection, but you would have to watch that your emotional nature does not get the better of you and lead you to indiscretions which you would later regret."
" An ability to concentrate could take you into computer programming or accountancy or any work requiring concentration and attention to detail.  You have, also, a flair for creative expression with your hands.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing much turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in conversation with those with whom you are not well-acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative with new acquaintances or in a large crowd.  As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly.  You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
" Systematic and practical in all you do, you enjoy the feeling of accomplishment from working diligently at a task.  You budget your personal finances very carefully.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair.  This name limits imagination, flexibility, responsiveness, and spontaneity in your nature.  It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures."
" You could do well in sales work or in meeting the public where quickness of mind and expression are all important.  You have many friends, but lose interest in people very quickly.  Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.  Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences."
" You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but are not inclined to pursue inspirational or creative expression as in music or the arts.  As you have modest ambitions, you are content to live from day to day and to save for your future.  You budget carefully and do not believe in frivolous spending.  You appreciate a settled home environment that permits you to show your love for friends and family through what you do for them rather than having to express your feelings in words.  Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail."
" You desire all the finer things in life--lovely clothes, home, furniture, and environment.  However, procrastination is your worst enemy, and you find yourself lacking the ambition to make your dreams a reality.  People are inclined to take advantage of your sympathetic, tractable nature.  You naturally attract people with problems who seek your understanding and advice.  You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself.  You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence."
" You are pleasant and diplomatic, and seem to sense how others feel.  For this reason, you could do well in public relations work.  You appreciate the finer things of life, and like to have a good standard of living.  You feel that it is important to convey the impression that you are financially secure, and you place importance on your mode of dress, and on appearances generally.  While you could do well in certain positions of authority, you have a certain lack of initiative and a tendency to procrastinate.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work. However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
" You make friends easily as people are attracted to your warm and generous nature.  However, you have to watch that others do not take advantage of your generosity, for you are apt to be influenced by hard-luck stories and give when it might be more prudent not to.  You are ever on the watch for ways and means of making some ""easy money"" because this name destroys initiative and ambition, producing an easy-going, come-what-may nature which attaches value to money only for the self-enjoyment it can offer.  Misunderstandings could exist in your personal life because of this emotional power which you have difficulty controlling and also because of a difficulty in accepting a responsibility and seeing it through.  You are apt to leave a project unfinished and go on to something else.  Routine and system are foreign to your life, and, of course, these assets are an integral part of any successful undertaking."
" This name does not give you great ambitions, vision, or imagination.  It frustrates the expression of your softer, feminine qualities in that you find it difficult to express the depth of your feelings for those you love.  It limits you to practical matters of the day, filling your life with detailed routine. hard work, and monotony."
" You have the gift of tact and diplomacy, and possess a charming, easy-going nature which endears you to others.  You have a serious desire to understand the heart and mind of everyone, and could be very effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.  This name also gives you a love of home and family, and as a parent you would likely be fair and understanding.  You remember the thoughtful little expressions of affection and appreciation that mean so much to others, and you have the ability to create a warm and loving environment.  However, you tend to put things off and avoid facing issues because of a lack of confidence and uncertainty.  You often need encouragement from someone before you can come to a decision."
" There are people in your association who could influence you unfavourably and thereby mislead you; disillusionment, embarrassment, and bitter experiences then become your lot.  You have a very talkative nature and because of it, you could do well in saleswork or in a position where you handle the public.  However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
" However, this name has made you rather aggressive, shrewd, and critical and has caused you to be extremely independent.  It is difficult for you to express fully the softer, more feminine qualities that should be a part of your nature.  This name creates such a strong, positive nature, that the more sensitive types of people would find it overpowering at times."
"Mental tension could result through worrying too much over your problems or the problems of others, with an adverse effect on your nervous system."
Your whole nervous system could be affected by the intense emotional influence of this name.
"You must fight to overcome a tendency to indulge in rich foods and the pleasures of life which could undermine your health.  Weaknesses in the health could affect the nervous system, and also the prostate gland or other generative organs."
" Your verbal expression does not reflect your inner thoughts and feelings, and you often wonder why people react to what you say.  The influence of this name does not promote the friendship that you desire or the relaxation and naturalness you should enjoy with people.  It is a name that makes you far too practical and serious-minded, and makes it difficult for you to act with spontaneity."
" You have an empathy for the problems of others, particularly on social or economic issues, and you would gain satisfaction doing work of a humanitarian nature.  You have a clever mind and must have an interest outside the home to be happy.  Because of your interest in business and the affairs of the world, you find it easy to converse with all types of people.  There is a tendency for you to possess and control those closest to you, and, as a result, you would suffer with shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Your feelings are very strong and you have difficulty in controlling your temper.  You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods."
"Health problems arise due to worry and a sensitivity in the respiratory area which could lead to problems with the heart, lungs, or bronchial area."
" You love the security of a home and family, you are fond of children, and, as a parent you would be fair and understanding.  Although you have good business judgment, you are not aggressive in your dealings because you do not like to create issues.  You would be successful in any position dealing with the public as you have a diplomatic and tactful manner and possess a charming, easy-going nature which puts people at ease.  People are drawn to you because they feel that you are patient, kind, understanding, and responsive.  You would be effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.  While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues."
 It has created separateness from others and loneliness in your life.
" Your initiative often causes you to be the first to act when you see a need.  Since you are impressionable and receptive, you feel the misfortunes of others very keenly.  However, this name makes it awkward for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings with finesse and diplomacy to the extent that your candid, sometimes blunt, manner of speaking creates misunderstandings with others.  Being somewhat self-centred, you learn through your own experiences, as you rarely take advice from others.  Yet, you are sensitive and very easily hurt and offended.  You long for praise and appreciation for your efforts, but others find it difficult to understand you.  You dislike monotony and system and enjoy being creative in an inventive way whether it be in interior decorating, music, art, crafts, or other endeavours that require versatility and skill.  You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
" You have a strong, determined nature and you must be careful that you do not dominate or interfere in the lives of others in your desire to be helpful.  This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" You enjoy a daily routine and settled conditions, once you have found a comfortable niche in life.  You resist changes until you have examined an idea in detail and until all facts fall into place.  If you have to make a change, it is not easy to do so happily.  You do not readily change your ideas unless you are thoroughly convinced that you must."
" You can be very analytical, exacting, and patient in your undertakings until your interest is exhausted, at which time you switch to something else even though it means leaving your undertakings unfinished.  This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  You can be a stickler for detail, and very fussy and particular.  As spontaneous verbal expression can be difficult for you, you often feel awkward and embarrassed in situations requiring tact and diplomacy."
" Although you have good business judgment, you are not aggressive in your dealings because you do not like to create issues.  You would be successful in any position dealing with the public as you have a diplomatic and tactful manner and possess a charming, easy-going nature which puts people at ease.  People are drawn to you because they feel that you are patient, kind, understanding, and responsive.  You would be effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.  While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues."
" Interested in art, music, singing, dancing, and anything of an artistic nature, you could become a very fine performer. Your spontaneous expression stands you in good stead during arguments or debates, though you are perhaps too outspoken and inclined to sarcasm.  A very real weakness of this name is lack of system and order.  The use of this name makes it extremely difficult to carry through and finish the things you start.  It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.  You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" You have many friends because of your generous, happy nature, but if crossed you have a quick temper, although your annoyance does not last too long.  You do enjoy an argument and will at times say things just to get others going and then you sit back and enjoy the debate.  You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money.  This name creates a nature that can be the life of the party, but many times you can become involved in emotional situations against your better judgment.  Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to."
" You start new endeavours and incorporate new ideas, but seldom if ever receive the full benefits and financial accumulation for your efforts.  You tend to feel very frustrated in being unable to realize your ambitions fully.  An extremely independent and self-sufficient person, you dislike taking orders or advice from anyone.  You believe in speaking directly and to the point, so you are candid and abrupt.  Many friendships are lost because of your directness.  Those in close association complain that you are not inclined to observe and return acts of kindness, compassion, or affection.  You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
" Though you have limitless enthusiasm for new ventures, you lose interest quickly once things become routine, as you dislike being forced to attend to detail and do monotonous work.  Your lack of patience and consistency in your affairs and your tendency to act impulsively can lead to actions you later regret taking, or to accidents, particularly to the head.  You find that you often do the hard, pioneering work in an undertaking, only to see others reap the benefits.  While this name makes you very honest and sincere in your personal relationships, your tendency to retaliate with caustic remarks over even slight offenses could spoil many friendships."
" It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.  You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" This name gives you an optimistic outlook on life.  You appreciate good quality in all things and want the best money can buy.  You have big ideals and dreams about the things you would like but you are not always willing to put forth the necessary effort, particularly if it means being subservient to others or having to work in an unimportant, menial capacity.  Position and means are important to you and, in order to create this impression of affluence, you will spend even when it is not prudent to do so.  You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.  You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
" Your idealistic and sensitive nature gives you a deep appreciation for the finer things of life and a strong desire to be of service to humanity.  There are times when you experience inner turbulence at your inability to say what you mean.  It is far easier for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings through writing than verbally.  You find pleasure in literature, in poetry, and in your ideals and will turn to them when you feel you have been misunderstood.  You are deeply moved by the beauties of life, especially nature.  Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next.  Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" You have a tendency, at times, to have too many ideas on the go, and thus your efforts are scattered and many things do not reach completion.  You are inclined to do to excess the things you like to do.  You have very intense feelings and find it difficult to maintain stability and happiness.  If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
 You tend to be impulsive and could attract accidents as a result.
"You have a good appetite, and appreciate the best and richest foods.  For this reason, you could possibly suffer with an over-heated bloodstream, which in turn affects the skin, causing rashes and eczema."
 Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs.
"Your fondness for excess quantities of heavy, starchy foods could cause stomach or intestinal disorders; you could also suffer with head tension, affecting the eyes, ears, sinus, or throat."
" You are an organizer and leader who exercises sound and fair judgment in all your dealings, both business and personal.  The name is a very practical influence, causing you to take your responsibilities seriously.  At times it is difficult for you to see the lighter or more humourous side of a situation because of your serious attitude.  Your highly capable and efficient nature make it difficult for some people to approach you.  Although you desire to serve your fellow man, you may at times lack tolerance for those who are less self-assured and whose approach to life is not as positive and optimistic as your own.  You are strongly independent and would be happiest when working without supervision, preferably in your own business where you have the challenge of ""standing or falling"" by your own decisions.  A good material standard of living is of utmost importance to you and you are careful to select only the best quality in all your purchases.  You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
 You could suffer bitter experiences through attracting wrong types of association and can be drawn into circumstances involving you in unwise situations.
" Your dislike for monotony and routine, often means that you do not finish the things you start.  A natural rhythm, a sense of colour harmony, and creative ability contribute to a flair for composition and artistic and musical expression.  Expression comes easily to you; in fact, you should learn to control it and discipline your expression. You are not practical where money matters are concerned, your theory being that money is there to be spent.  You are kind and generous, and will fill a need when you see it; at times, others take advantage of your generosity. The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
" This restlessness makes it difficult for you to assume responsibility and to establish stable, progressive conditions in your life.  You could do well in sales work or in meeting the public where quickness of mind and expression are all important.  You have many friends, but lose interest in people very quickly.  Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.  Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences."
" Also, you do not appreciate people enforcing  new methods or ideas on you, as you like to examine all the details before making changes.  It is difficult for you to be spontaneous and affectionate with those close to you, as suitable words and actions do not come to mind quickly.  In association your tendency to state your mind simply and clearly, without diplomacy or finesse, can lead to awkwardness or embarrassment."
" Your enthusiasm, aggressiveness, and salesmanship are often sufficient to bring about fulfillment of your ambitions.  However, in the attempt to impress others with the scope of your success, you can over-extend your resources to the point that you have inadequate means to cover your basic expenses.  There are times when you would be advised to start in a smaller way, and gradually reach your desired level of success through perseverance, patience, and attention to details.  When things are going well, you have a generous, magnanimous nature, ready to offer support and assistance to others.  When under stress, you can become overbearing and belittling in your attitude to others, and inclined to express sarcasm and temper.  Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own world of personal relationships or material possessions, you could suffer disappointments with those close to you, unfulfilled ideals, or material losses."
"However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
" You tend to treat new and unfamiliar ideas with scepticism.  Because of the serious, responsible qualities of your name, you must recognize the importance of a sense of humour and optimistic perspective of life.  In some ways you are not overly emotional and sympathetic to others and can be shrewd and materialistic.  Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
 Your impulsive nature could lead to accidents.
" Although you desire to serve your fellow man, you may at times lack tolerance for those who are less self-assured and whose approach to life is not as positive and optimistic as your own.  You are strongly independent and would be happiest when working without supervision, preferably in your own business where you have the challenge of ""standing or falling"" by your own decisions.  A good material standard of living is of utmost importance to you and you are careful to select only the best quality in all your purchases.  You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
" Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
"Physically you suffer through tension in the generative organs which could cause female disorders.  There is also an over-sensitivity in the heart, lungs, and bronchial area which could lead to related health weaknesses."
" Where you have difficulty is in organizing and systematizing the handling of your responsibilities.  Though you can work on any undertaking intently as long as it absorbs your interest, you cannot persevere when confronted by obstacles or by tedious monotony.  Thus your success in your undertakings is limited.  The tasks or activities you enjoy the most allow some form of creative or artistic expression.  You will never tolerate a situation where your independence and individuality are curtailed.  Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
"You are capable of logical and analytical thinking along practical business lines, and could excel in financial fields, law, or politics. Your judgment is seldom swayed through your feelings. You have definite executive and leadership abilities, however others may find you to be rather forceful and uncompromising. More congenial business and personal relationships would result from being more tactful and more aware of the needs of others. If you sacrifice too much for material ambition, there may result a lack of harmony and balance in your personal life."
" You crave affection and understanding, yet because you can be so easily and deeply hurt, you have learned to keep your true nature hidden; therefore people do not really know you.  You always wonder if you are doing the right thing, desiring to express yourself but afraid to.  People may consider you haughty and aloof because of your sensitivity and reserved ways.  You may find some expression abut it would usually be light conversation, rarely daring to reveal your deeper thoughts or take others into your confidence for fear of criticism or ridicule.  You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
" The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
" Loving the outdoors, you enjoy outside activities and the beauty of nature in its many facets.  Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets."
" You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
"For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions."
" Also, budgeting can be a problem as you enjoy spending money and can easily ignore being practical."
" With acquaintances and strangers, you tend to be reticent and reserved.  Your friends never know whether they will find you friendly and charming or lost in introspection.  When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" You see the humorous side of many situations and can laugh at yourself as well as at others.  This name gives you a musical, artistic nature and you would do well in any occupation in the entertainment field.  You have many friends because of your generous, happy nature, but if crossed you have a quick temper, although your annoyance does not last too long.  You do enjoy an argument and will at times say things just to get others going and then you sit back and enjoy the debate.  You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money.  This name creates a nature that can be the life of the party, but many times you can become involved in emotional situations against your better judgment.  Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to."
" You are serious-minded and not inclined to make light of things even in little ways, and in your younger years you had more mature interests than others your age.  Home and family mean a great deal to you and it is natural that you should desire the security of a peaceful, settled home environment where you can enjoy the companionship of family and friends.  Whatever you set out to accomplish you do your very best to complete in accordance with what you consider to be right.  In the home you assume your responsibilities capably, having the self-confidence to form your own opinions and make your own decisions.  Others can rely on you; once you have given your word you will do your utmost to fulfil a responsibility.  However, there is a tendency to be a little too independent in your thinking and it is difficult for you to accept the help of others when you should."
" Your ideas can be very original and inventive.  You enjoy being with people in a social environment.  Your personal appearance is important to you, for you desire to make a good impression on others.  Your pleasant manner attracts people to you with their problems and you are capable of offering practical advice, though you would probably not follow such advice yourself.  This name causes you to be somewhat too concerned with the personalities, problems, and activities of other people.  You seem positive and decisive and can be outspoken in the expression of your opinions, but you lack the self-confidence needed to follow through with your ideas and plans.  Procrastination is your downfall.  You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition."
 You are particular and quite set in your way you want things to be done.  Once you have made up your mind or formed an opinion it is not easily changed.  Hence there is a restriction in friendships and business opportunities.
" Home and family mean a great deal to you and it is natural that you should desire the security of a peaceful, settled home environment where you can enjoy the companionship of family and friends.  Whatever you set out to accomplish you do your very best to complete in accordance with what you consider to be right.  In the home you assume your responsibilities capably, having the self-confidence to form your own opinions and make your own decisions.  Others can rely on you; once you have given your word you will do your utmost to fulfil a responsibility.  However, there is a tendency to be a little too independent in your thinking and it is difficult for you to accept the help of others when you should."
"  Personal relationships suffer sometimes because you are inclined to overlook the little things, such as thoughtful and appreciative gestures.   This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" You prefer to be alone with your own thoughts, rather than in the company of others.  This name restricts spontaneity in association and the fluency of your verbal expression.  When you are required to express yourself in personal matters requiring finesse and diplomacy, you feel awkward and embarrassed.  Although you realize perfectly well what is expected of you, you are unable to find the right words, and hence you end up saying something inappropriate in a candid way.  You can express your deeper thoughts and feelings best through writing.  Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.  You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
" Patience is not one of your virtues; you want to move when the impulse strikes you.  While such spontaneity is fine at times, you must take account of conditions and employ careful analysis so as to avoid disastrous results such as accidents due to hasty actions.  Most things you do, you do well, but as soon as the task, hobby, or job becomes familiar or routine, you are bored and crave a change.  Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" This name has given you a gregarious personality and a quick-thinking, creative, and versatile nature, but one that is unstable emotionally.  You desire change and travel and would enjoy opportunities that allowed you to be creative and to act independently, rather than to conform to system and routine.  However, this name does not allow you to complete your undertakings, as farther fields always look greener.  Although you may appear confident and positive, you actually lack confidence and feel self-conscious at times.  This name spoils patience and depth of thought, and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence."
" In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" Hence you seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.  There are people in your association who could influence you unfavourably and thereby mislead you; disillusionment, embarrassment, and bitter experiences then become your lot.  You have a very talkative nature and because of it, you could do well in saleswork or in a position where you handle the public.  However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
" You are ambitious, desire the best in life, and appreciate quality in all things. You are creative, promotional, and versatile, all qualities leading to success in the financial side of your life.  However, this name has made you rather aggressive, shrewd, and critical and has caused you to be extremely independent.  It is difficult for you to express fully the softer, more feminine qualities that should be a part of your nature.  This name creates such a strong, positive nature, that the more sensitive types of people would find it overpowering at times."
" You could achieve heights of success in business, but there is also a factor which brings many forced changes and friction with people, which in turn offsets the success you could achieve.  The more sensitive types of people find you overpowering at times.  You tend to have too many irons in the fire and fail to complete your undertakings satisfactorily.  Business success could be achieved, to a point, abut your personal life would suffer.  It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive."
"The weakness of this name could create nervous breakdowns, or disorders related to the nervous system."
"Physical weaknesses would show in your heart, lungs, or bronchial area. "
" You desire independence and freedom from the authority and interference of others.  You are not overly ambitious, preferring instead just to seek stable, settled conditions which are adequate to meet your responsibilities.  In your personal relations with others, you are inclined to be rather serious, and not to see the humour others see, or to respond spontaneously.  Your positive manner and outlook can make others feel that you are imposing your will on them and even interfering in their affairs."
" You are rather studious, mentally challenging each new idea before accepting it.  Because you learn so quickly you have little patience with those whose mental processes are somewhat slower, and you could become supercilious or somewhat ""know it all"" in your attitude.  This characteristic could make you rather unpopular with your associates.  Although you are very knowledgeable and intelligent, you often find spontaneous verbal expression difficult.  You crave friendship, understanding, love, and affection but your reserved manner appears forbidding to others.  You can give expression to your personal thoughts and feelings most fluently through the written word.  You have a sensitive nature--sensitive to your environment and particularly sensitive to how your deeper and more serious interests are regarded by others.  Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
 You love to read and can develop great powers of concentration.
" Your name gives you a natural desire to express along artistic and musical lines.  You desire a settled home and family life, and are expressive and attentive to your loved ones.  You must be careful not to become possessive and jealous of those close to you, however, as you could attract losses and unfortunate experiences.  If you attach an ideal of service to your life, you could find great happiness and could express a very beautiful, happy, responsible, artistic, and generous nature."
" You tend to have too many irons in the fire and fail to complete your undertakings satisfactorily.  Business success could be achieved, to a point, abut your personal life would suffer.  It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive."
Your health could suffer in the intestinal tract and related difficulties such as arthritis or rheumatism.
"You live much within your own thoughts, and seek relaxation away from people, out in nature, where you can ease the tensions of your life.  You find it difficult to express your true feelings, whether it be affection, appreciation, or tenderness, which play such an important part in creating a close bond within the family."
" However, independence, positivity and the urge for action and progress are such strong forces in your nature that you find it difficult to control them.  You feel happy as long as headway is being made, but as soon as you are obstructed or your individuality and freedom of action are restricted, you experience an intense nervous reaction.  Moods of depression can result during which you become caustic and belligerent in your attitude toward everyone, especially to those in closest association with you.  Routine, monotony, and the responsibility of looking after details can have a similar effect on you, as you are a person who desires change, travel, and new experiences.  In order to gain greater congeniality in your personal associations, you need to cultivate a more relaxed manner, greater generosity, understanding, and tolerance, and, above all, you need to avoid being too outspoken and self-opinionated."
" You crave friendship, understanding, love, and affection but your reserved manner appears forbidding to others.  You can give expression to your personal thoughts and feelings most fluently through the written word.  You have a sensitive nature--sensitive to your environment and particularly sensitive to how your deeper and more serious interests are regarded by others.  Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
" If you are repressed or restricted in any way, you become frustrated, moody, and depressed.  You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  With acquaintances and strangers, you tend to be reticent and reserved.  Your friends never know whether they will find you friendly and charming or lost in introspection.  When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" Being somewhat self-centred, you learn through your own experiences, as you rarely take advice from others.  Yet, you are sensitive and very easily hurt and offended.  You long for praise and appreciation for your efforts, but others find it difficult to understand you.  You dislike monotony and system and enjoy being creative in an inventive way whether it be in interior decorating, music, art, crafts, or other endeavours that require versatility and skill.  You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
" Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair, and you budget your personal finances very carefully. Because of its matter-of-fact influence, this name limits, to some degree, your ability to be flexible and spontaneous.  You tend to treat new and unfamiliar ideas with scepticism.  Because of the serious, responsible qualities of your name, you must recognize the importance of a sense of humour and optimistic perspective of life.  In some ways you are not overly emotional and sympathetic to others and can be shrewd and materialistic.  Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
" If you attach an ideal of service to your life, you could find great happiness and could express a very beautiful, happy, responsible, artistic, and generous nature."
" You need to see a concept presented completely in detail before you can understand it, and if you cannot understand it, you come to your own conclusion and often fail to listen to and reason out another's point of view.  You resist being forced into change and could become almost impervious to new ideas.  You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood."
" You could be inventive along scientific or technical lines.  Although you are not naturally spontaneous in musical or artistic expression, you can develop technical proficiency along these lines.  You are fussy about details and seek perfection in whatever you undertake.  Being somewhat wilful and skeptical, you learn best through your own experiences and seek proof though facts.  You work best alone, making your own decisions, and learning from your own experiences.  Despite your loyalty to friends, your communication at times is stilted, too candid, and frank."
" Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
" Because of your serious, self-possessed nature you can appear domineering and forceful to others.  You have a strong humanitarian nature and many times you are called upon to assist others with their problems.  Your desire to help sometimes is not appreciated, however, because they feel you are interfering.  You are fond of home and children and desire a settled environment.  You have an appreciation for music and art, and could express along these lines."
 You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition.
" You can express your deeper thoughts and feelings best through writing.  Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.  You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
"You hate to be hurried or to leave anything unfinished or untidy.  Your infinite patience would allow you to develop intricate, involved skills to perfection. Often feeling burdened with work, you worry about details out of proportion to their importance.  Having definite ideas, you are skeptical and do not change easily, for you require proof, preferably in complete detail before you will alter an opinion.  Once you are settled into a situation, you do not like to move or make changes.  When on a schedule, you follow it implicitly. Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
" You feel happy as long as headway is being made, but as soon as you are obstructed or your individuality and freedom of action are restricted, you experience an intense nervous reaction.  Moods of depression can result during which you become caustic and belligerent in your attitude toward everyone, especially to those in closest association with you.  Routine, monotony, and the responsibility of looking after details can have a similar effect on you, as you are a person who desires change, travel, and new experiences.  In order to gain greater congeniality in your personal associations, you need to cultivate a more relaxed manner, greater generosity, understanding, and tolerance, and, above all, you need to avoid being too outspoken and self-opinionated."
"You must guard against emotional excesses, which could result in depletion of energy, creating a desire for quick-energy foods.  You could suffer through skin irritations, blood conditions, back trouble, and later, through arthritis.  Heart, lung, or bronchial weaknesses could also result."
" As a result, you seem aloof.  Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
" It is difficult for you to say ""no"" and mean it or to carry through with any commitments you have made.  This name makes you too lackadaisical.  The influence of this name is to lack practicality, system and order, organizing ability, astuteness, and the ability to make decisions and act upon them.  Due to procrastination you have many unfulfilled desires.  You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
"Weaknesses in the health centre in the head, and in the stomach and intestinal organs.
"
" This name makes you too lackadaisical.  The influence of this name is to lack practicality, system and order, organizing ability, astuteness, and the ability to make decisions and act upon them.  Due to procrastination you have many unfulfilled desires.  You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
" Once you are settled into a situation, you do not like to move or make changes.  When on a schedule, you follow it implicitly. Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
Any health problems would show as tension in the nervous system brought on by worry.
"Having a large appetite, you could over-indulge in food causing a weakness in your health in the digestive and eliminative tract.  Health problems could also arise in the prostate gland and male generative organs later in life.
"
"Indulgences could result in skin rashes, liver problems, heart trouble, or lung and chest congestion."
" You judge most things by their material value and you are usually pre-occupied with seeking your own financial independence.  You desire to be in a position of leadership, for you can see where all the details fit into the overall situation and you have analytical and organizational ability.  You are seldom open to new ideas except those you can prove to yourself in a tangible way.  Imaginative, theoretical, or inspirational ideas are of little interest to you.  In close association you are not often attentive to the needs of others.  It is difficult for you to demonstrate tenderness and warmth and, consequently, personal relationships are not as harmonious as you wish them to be."
" Instead of establishing the system and order you would like, you are over-particular in some things that matter to you personally but lax and indulgent in other ways.  You place great importance on whatever you happen to be interested in, and can be quite thorough and detailed in what you are doing, but find it difficult to be consistent.  You scatter your efforts when things becomes too monotonous.  You have intense urges and feelings for which you can find no expression.  At times you are motivated more by moods and desires than by sound logic and reason, and under conditions of stress you could react inadvertently in temper or stubbornness that you would regret later."
" It is much more natural for you to express your deeper thoughts in writing.  A lack of positivity and confidence is a source of difficulty in making decisions in business dealings.  You are easily offended, and can suffer with moods of depression.  You want the best, but lack the confidence and aggressiveness to materialize your desires.  Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
 You can express yourself better through writing than verbally.  The mysteries of life appeal to you in your search for an understanding of the greater picture of life.  You love to read and can develop great powers of concentration.
" You struggle with the requirement to soften your expression with tact and diplomacy and to consider the feelings of others.  Difficulty in accepting advice or admitting that you may have made a mistake causes you to appear to be stubborn and set in your ways.  Thus, you have too often created the wrong impression, and friendships have suffered.  This name does offer creative talent where there is the opportunity for ingenuity and originality.  You have a tendency, at times, to have too many ideas on the go, and thus your efforts are scattered and many things do not reach completion.  You are inclined to do to excess the things you like to do.  You have very intense feelings and find it difficult to maintain stability and happiness.  If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
" You remember the thoughtful little expressions of affection and appreciation that mean so much to others, and you have the ability to create a warm and loving environment.  However, you tend to put things off and avoid facing issues because of a lack of confidence and uncertainty.  You often need encouragement from someone before you can come to a decision."
"Because of its matter-of-fact influence, this name limits, to some degree, your ability to be flexible and spontaneous.  You tend to treat new and unfamiliar ideas with scepticism.  Because of the serious, responsible qualities of your name, you must recognize the importance of a sense of humour and optimistic perspective of life.  In some ways you are not overly emotional and sympathetic to others and can be shrewd and materialistic.  Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
" If you could express only the constructive qualities and restrain the negative qualities of your nature, you would always be good company.  These contrasting qualities make it difficult for people to understand you and can lead to friction in your personal life.  You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed over any real or imagined slight.  You feel and sense much more than you can fully understand, and could become psychic if you delved into the occult.  The problem then would be controllable thoughts, feelings, and reactions.  You find it difficult to be patient, practical, and systematic, preferring to act impulsively as the spirit moves you."
" Being clever, imaginative, and analytical, you do very well in the activities that hold your attention.  You long for freedom from restrictions and for outlets for your restless qualities, and cannot tolerate drudgery and monotony.  It is not easy for you to take advice, subsequently; you tend to work alone or independently.  You suffer inner turmoil and moods at times especially when you feel misunderstood, and being extremely sensitive, you are easily hurt and offended.  Your quiet intensity is difficult for others to understand and thus, you are on guard for fear of being ridiculed or criticized.  Loving the outdoors, you enjoy outside activities and the beauty of nature in its many facets.  Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets."
" You can be creative, inventive, and ingenious in practical matters, such as handicrafts.  When you have the opportunity to pursue your own goals and interests free from interference, you can feel very agreeable and express a buoyant optimism.  On the other hand, you can be impulsive and forceful when opposed, and act without due forethought and discretion.  Hence you have many bitter experiences and generally rather unsettled conditions in your life, with little progress and financial accumulation.  You cannot tolerate any domination by others, or circumstances that restrict your freedom and independence.  You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions.  When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.  Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
"The indulgences prompted by this name can lead to high blood pressure and its relative ailments, as well as nervous tension affecting the whole nervous system.
"
" Being consistent and stable in your nature, you are decisive, capable, and efficient, though not always tactful in expressing your opinions.  Your appreciation of art and music is focused around how to make these activities into viable financial opportunities.  At times, you create misunderstandings with others as it is not easy for you to be diplomatic."
" There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" This name does make you quite direct and straight-to-the-point.  Your verbal expression does not reflect your inner thoughts and feelings, and you often wonder why people react to what you say.  The influence of this name does not promote the friendship that you desire or the relaxation and naturalness you should enjoy with people.  It is a name that makes you far too practical and serious-minded, and makes it difficult for you to act with spontaneity."
" You are affectionate, and respond quickly to appreciation.  As a child you were expressive.  An imaginative, impressionable person, you could excel in the theatre as a dramatist or comedienne, and the enjoyment and appreciation of your audience would be your greatest inspiration.  Fine as your nature is at times the power of your feelings is difficult to control as it unleashes itself through outbursts of temper.  The name does not engender emotional stability; nor have you the system and order in your thinking always to finish what you start.  Scattering of efforts interferes with success in your undertakings."
" Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next.  Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" You appreciate change and travel, and the opportunity to meet and mix with others, and to influence them with your creative ideas.  You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses and bitter experiences.  This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association."
" You enjoy change, travel, and new experiences.  Reacting against injustice, you go out of your way to assist in creating fairness.  You are very creative and promotional, and work intensely to carry out your plans.  Though you have limitless enthusiasm for new ventures, you lose interest quickly once things become routine, as you dislike being forced to attend to detail and do monotonous work.  Your lack of patience and consistency in your affairs and your tendency to act impulsively can lead to actions you later regret taking, or to accidents, particularly to the head.  You find that you often do the hard, pioneering work in an undertaking, only to see others reap the benefits.  While this name makes you very honest and sincere in your personal relationships, your tendency to retaliate with caustic remarks over even slight offenses could spoil many friendships."
" Your ambitions are not large, as you lack confidence in your own abilities and would sooner not take a chance.  You are often at odds with yourself, knowing what you should do, but finding it hard to find the initiative and will power to do it.  Liking to plan and think ahead, you do not act impulsively and do not like to have your plans or routine interfered with. You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
" You do not like to create tension or friction and will try various means to avoid such situations.  You are very idealistic.  You have imagination and many ideas but lack the ambition and drive necessary to accomplish your undertakings.  Many times you dream about the things you desire in life, but when it comes down to putting forth the necessary effort and accomplishing your goals, you do not have the strength and initiative.  This name does not allow you the system and order your life requires to run in a smooth, efficient way, and if possible you will avoid having to make decisions because you feel much more secure when you can lean on others.  Many times you make promises you do not keep, although your intentions are always good."
"You could experience headaches, or problems with your teeth, ears, eyes, or sinuses.  Health weaknesses relative to the functioning of the liver could appear."
" As spontaneous verbal expression can be difficult for you, you often feel awkward and embarrassed in situations requiring tact and diplomacy."
" You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
 You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life.
" Fairness is important to you and you could be drawn to the justice system.   Personal relationships suffer sometimes because you are inclined to overlook the little things, such as thoughtful and appreciative gestures.   This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" You are able to work well with people and can capably direct their activities.  You enjoy music and art, and love to meet and mix with people.  An appreciation for quality has prompted you to strive for the best standard in dress, material possessions, and choice of food.  On occasion, you can be intolerant and critical of others, quick to argue and to dominate situations.  Though the name offers a fair degree of balance, you would have to watch that strong appetites do not find an outlet through excessive eating, causing overweight and resultant problems, or through emotional experiences which could create unsettled conditions in your personal life."
" When you have the opportunity to pursue your own goals and interests free from interference, you can feel very agreeable and express a buoyant optimism.  On the other hand, you can be impulsive and forceful when opposed, and act without due forethought and discretion.  Hence you have many bitter experiences and generally rather unsettled conditions in your life, with little progress and financial accumulation.  You cannot tolerate any domination by others, or circumstances that restrict your freedom and independence.  You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions.  When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.  Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
" You love children and would not hesitate to care for any children who might need you.  Whenever possible, you avoid argument and turmoil because you prefer not to face an issue if it means hurting anyone's feelings.  You shrink from sordidness and poverty because you feel very deeply for anyone in unfortunate circumstances.  Though you recognize your responsibilities, you are inclined to put things off until you are forced to take action.  If given the opportunity, you could develop musical and artistic abilities."
" Expression comes naturally to you and you are rarely at a loss for words; in fact, you have to put forth effort at times to curb an over-active tongue.  Self-confidence has made it easy for you to meet people and you are well-liked for your spontaneous, happy ways.  You sincerely like people and do not often experience loneliness; your work and home-life are likely filled with association   You enjoy music and could have a fine singing voice; however, the study could be somewhat difficult because you do not find it easy to apply yourself to concentrated study for long periods.  In this respect, this name is not altogether constructive; it creates a somewhat scattering influence which makes it difficult for you to finish what you start.  This name brings disappointments and emotional involvements through being too sympathetic and easily influenced."
" You find it difficult to express your true feelings, whether it be affection, appreciation, or tenderness, which play such an important part in creating a close bond within the family."
" Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair, and you budget your personal finances very carefully.  You are clever in mathematics and have great patience with work of a detailed nature, such as bookkeeping or accounting.  Systematic and practical in all you do, you enjoy the feeling of accomplishment from working diligently at a task.  You budget your personal finances very carefully.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair.  This name limits imagination, flexibility, responsiveness, and spontaneity in your nature.  It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures."
" You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
" Hence you have many bitter experiences and generally rather unsettled conditions in your life, with little progress and financial accumulation.  You cannot tolerate any domination by others, or circumstances that restrict your freedom and independence.  You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions.  When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.  Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
" You can work intently at whatever is new and holds your interest at the moment, but your interest wanes quickly when drudgery and monotony set in.  Obstacles to your progress or restrictions on your freedom to act create a sense of frustration which may cause you to feel resentful and even rebellious.  You can then become intolerant of others, and caustic and belittling in your expression, thereby imposing stress on your personal relationships.  Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents.  Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts."
"  You have a great deal of patience and independence, and you can be relied upon to complete your undertakings.  You are stable, trustworthy, homeloving, and logical in practical matters, but rather unresponsive to suggestions from others.  You resist change.  This name does not give you great ambitions, vision, or imagination.  It frustrates the expression of your softer, feminine qualities in that you find it difficult to express the depth of your feelings for those you love.  It limits you to practical matters of the day, filling your life with detailed routine. hard work, and monotony."
" In an argument, you usually emerge the victor, but at a cost."
" However, this name makes it awkward for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings with finesse and diplomacy to the extent that your candid, sometimes blunt, manner of speaking creates misunderstandings with others.  Being somewhat self-centred, you learn through your own experiences, as you rarely take advice from others.  Yet, you are sensitive and very easily hurt and offended.  You long for praise and appreciation for your efforts, but others find it difficult to understand you.  You dislike monotony and system and enjoy being creative in an inventive way whether it be in interior decorating, music, art, crafts, or other endeavours that require versatility and skill.  You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
" You can work intently at whatever is new and holds your interest at the moment, but your interest wanes quickly when drudgery and monotony set in.  Obstacles to your progress or restrictions on your freedom to act create a sense of frustration which may cause you to feel resentful and even rebellious.  You can then become intolerant of others, and caustic and belittling in your expression, thereby imposing stress on your personal relationships.  Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents."
" Others can rely on you; once you have given your word you will do your utmost to fulfil a responsibility.  However, there is a tendency to be a little too independent in your thinking and it is difficult for you to accept the help of others when you should."
" In an argument, you usually emerge victor, but at a cost.  This name does not offer the softness of expression for long-lasting compatibility in close associations."
" The desires for independence and financial success have been strong motivating forces from early in your life. You are capable of logical and analytical thinking along practical business lines, and could excel in financial fields, law, or politics. Your judgment is seldom swayed through your feelings. You have definite executive and leadership abilities, however others may find you to be rather forceful and uncompromising. More congenial business and personal relationships would result from being more tactful and more aware of the needs of others. If you sacrifice too much for material ambition, there may result a lack of harmony and balance in your personal life."
 Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail.
" Thus, you have too often created the wrong impression, and friendships have suffered.  This name does offer creative talent where there is the opportunity for ingenuity and originality.  You have a tendency, at times, to have too many ideas on the go, and thus your efforts are scattered and many things do not reach completion.  You are inclined to do to excess the things you like to do.  You have very intense feelings and find it difficult to maintain stability and happiness.  If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
" As a result, you experience moods of depression and self-pity and often avoid facing issues. A lack of confidence leads to procrastination, a need for support and encouragement from others, and a vulnerability to be taken advantage of in many situations."
" It is a name, however, which almost destroys the finer, sensitive qualities that should be expressed.  It makes spontaneous, natural expression difficult.  Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs."
" You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
" Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
" You do not find contentment in the routine tasks and responsibilities that are associated with home and family or with administrative detail in the business world, so you have to guard against frustration and even moods of depression over your personal responsibilities.  The restlessness this name creates could find an outlet in caustic, irritable expression."
"Your name has given you a desire for heavy, rich foods, which cause sluggish digestion.  You could suffer with constipation, stomach, or intestinal disorders, or disturbances in the fluid functions of the body."
" You appear quite confident outwardly, but you do suffer with lack of confidence at times and draw upon the support and encouragement of others.  Although you desire to create harmony in your associations, you can be too candid in your expression, especially if you are challenged by others.  Then you can be quietly stubborn and resist taking advice.  You want to be more expressive, diplomatic, and easy-going, but you feel the limitation in your communication with others and it creates frustration within you."
" You appreciate the company of others, to the point that you do not like to be by yourself for very long.  You are gifted with natural expression, both verbal and musical, but you would find it tedious to study music and practice theory.  Anything that involves concentration or just plain hard work, you prefer to avoid as best you can.  Although you have many creative, original ideas, procrastination is your worst enemy because you can seldom make decisions and carry them out.  In your desire to gain the favour of others and to keep peace, because you abhor friction, you change your opinion to agree with those at hand.  It is easy for you to express love and affection, but you would have to watch that your emotional nature does not get the better of you and lead you to indiscretions which you would later regret."
" As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly.  You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
" Being rather secretive in many ways, and not liking people to pry into your affairs restrict opportunities for friendship; not until you feel you can trust others do you open up to them.  The desire to help others and the generous side of your nature attract those who take advantage of you.  You lack the necessary aggressiveness for business success.  While you lack verbal expression and spontaneity under this name, you have a natural literary ability and writing comes easily to you.  You also have a deep appreciation of nature and all the finer things in life."
" You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative.  As a result, you seem aloof.  Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
"Health weaknesses affect the intestinal tract. There is also a weakness in the fluid functions of the body, causing either swelling of the legs and ankles, phlebitis, or varicose veins."
" Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
" You respond quickly to kind words or any appreciation shown you.  There are artistic, creative abilities in this name that you could express through music or singing, or, in a practical way, through sewing or interior decorating.  You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature.  In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
" An urge for independence causes dissatisfaction and frustration in close relationships and you find the ""ties that bind"" restricting.  The qualities of this name would find a more constructive outlet in work that involves high-pressure selling or promotional activities, possibly in community affairs, for it contains a positive, driving power.  It is difficult for you to merge with others; although you have quickness of mind, you lack tolerance and can give way to impatience at another's slowness or shortcomings.  If you cannot complete your plans when you wish to do so, you could suffer intense moods of depression and extreme sensitivity in the region of the solar plexus, resulting possibly in ulcers or nervous disorders.  This name could take you into bitter experiences through impulsive action."
 This name causes you to suffer with self-consciousness in new situations and an inability to be diplomatic when situations warrant.  You are loyal in friendships and express candidly.   You enjoy outdoors activities with a few close friends.
" Because your feelings and desires are so changeable, you are never satisfied with conditions as they are.  You have many ideas, plans, and ambitions, but too often they are for an easy way out of a difficulty or an easy way of making money.  You seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.   You find it difficult to systematize your efforts and to fulfil your obligations and plans as you are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job to reach your goals.  Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power.  This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people.  The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
" All the finer things of life and beauties of nature are an inspiration to you and you are attracted to the mysteries of nature.  Difficulty in expression results in your being too positive, blunt, and candid in speech.  Although you are easily offended by others, you do not show it.  You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof.  The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs. 
" Though the name offers a fair degree of balance, you would have to watch that strong appetites do not find an outlet through excessive eating, causing overweight and resultant problems, or through emotional experiences which could create unsettled conditions in your personal life."
" Anything that involves concentration or just plain hard work, you prefer to avoid as best you can.  Although you have many creative, original ideas, procrastination is your worst enemy because you can seldom make decisions and carry them out.  In your desire to gain the favour of others and to keep peace, because you abhor friction, you change your opinion to agree with those at hand.  It is easy for you to express love and affection, but you would have to watch that your emotional nature does not get the better of you and lead you to indiscretions which you would later regret."
" You can then become intolerant of others, and caustic and belittling in your expression, thereby imposing stress on your personal relationships.  Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents.  Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts."
"In health, this name affects the nervous system and also the fluid functions, giving rise to kidney or bladder weaknesses."
" When you are required to express yourself in personal matters requiring finesse and diplomacy, you feel awkward and embarrassed.  Although you realize perfectly well what is expected of you, you are unable to find the right words, and hence you end up saying something inappropriate in a candid way.  You can express your deeper thoughts and feelings best through writing.  Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.  You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
" You like to work at your own speed, without pressure, as you prefer to take your time to work step by step in your own way.  You could become frustrated and thwarted in your efforts if too many changes or disruptions occur.  Also, you do not appreciate people enforcing  new methods or ideas on you, as you like to examine all the details before making changes.  It is difficult for you to be spontaneous and affectionate with those close to you, as suitable words and actions do not come to mind quickly.  In association your tendency to state your mind simply and clearly, without diplomacy or finesse, can lead to awkwardness or embarrassment."
" Your delight in mystery could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, uncontrolled thoughts make it difficult for you to retain emotional stability, and prevent you from finding proper peace and relaxation.  You tend to centre your interest too much on whatever means the most to you, and then you become over-possessive and suffer through disillusionment and fear of losses."
" Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" You are happiest when you are associating with people and participating in activities with others.  Your name gives you a desire to sing, dance, and have a good time.  This name makes you very idealistic, emotional, and temperamental, liking to do things on the spur-of-the-moment and disliking being repressed or held down to monotonous detail.  A lack of  concentration makes it difficult to establish stable, secure conditions in your business life.  In order to bring out the higher side of your nature, you should develop your artistic and creative talents."
" You are not inclined to merge your opinions and viewpoints with others, to accept compromise, or to work in a subservient position against your will.  Your expression is invariably quite direct and candid, and lacks the moderating tone of tact, diplomacy, and friendliness.  Others find it difficult to accept your domineering and, at times, argumentative manner.  Your circle of friends is restricted to those of like nature.  Once friendship is established, you are very loyal and steadfast and do not tolerate gossip or criticism.  In your close associations and family life, there is little demonstration of sentiment, appreciation, sympathy, or encouragement.  It is difficult for you to find the right words for such circumstances."
"Any emotional outbursts or moods would register as tension in your solar plexus, resulting in nervous indigestion and related problems.  Tension could also centre in the head affecting the eyes, ears, sinuses, or teeth.  True relaxation and peace of mind are elusive under this name.
"
"You find it difficult to be in positions of subservience or where you are taking advice from others.  You desire the best and want to be successful and financially prosperous and are willing to give practical help where it is deserved.  You are ambitious and practical and often look at things for their financial viability.  Fairness is important to you and you could be drawn to the justice system.   Personal relationships suffer sometimes because you are inclined to overlook the little things, such as thoughtful and appreciative gestures.   This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
"You could experience sensitivity in the heart, lungs, or bronchial organs, causing tuberculosis, asthma, or depletion of your energies."
" Although you desire to be spontaneous and natural, you are often drawn into technical and methodical lines of endeavour and the incidentals of life.  You are friendly by nature, but you cannot enjoy complete ease in association because of a difficulty in expressing yourself.  While you can be exacting and thorough in whatever you decide to undertake, and desire to keep a well-ordered life with everything in its place, it is not easy for you to maintain the system and order you would like.  There is conflict between your desires and your expression which does not allow scope for your capabilities.  This lack of fulfilment of your deeper qualities tends to create repression and frustration."
 You also have a deep appreciation of nature and all the finer things in life.
 Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life.
" This name also gives you a love of home and family, and as a parent you would likely be fair and understanding.  You remember the thoughtful little expressions of affection and appreciation that mean so much to others, and you have the ability to create a warm and loving environment.  However, you tend to put things off and avoid facing issues because of a lack of confidence and uncertainty.  You often need encouragement from someone before you can come to a decision."
" You find that you often do the hard, pioneering work in an undertaking, only to see others reap the benefits.  While this name makes you very honest and sincere in your personal relationships, your tendency to retaliate with caustic remarks over even slight offenses could spoil many friendships."
" The influence of this name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally.  You are never satisfied with conditions, because your feelings and desires are so changeable.  Hence you seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.  There are people in your association who could influence you unfavourably and thereby mislead you; disillusionment, embarrassment, and bitter experiences then become your lot.  You have a very talkative nature and because of it, you could do well in saleswork or in a position where you handle the public.  However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
"When under strain, tension could affect the stomach and solar plexus.  There is a tendency for you to worry."
" You can be a stickler for detail, and very fussy and particular.  As spontaneous verbal expression can be difficult for you, you often feel awkward and embarrassed in situations requiring tact and diplomacy."
" Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.  Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences."
" Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" Not interested in large undertakings, you are content to live from day to day to save for your future.  Always budgeting carefully, you do not believe in frivolous spending.  You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but you are not especially imaginative or investigative.  You are particular and quite set in your way you want things to be done.  Once you have made up your mind or formed an opinion it is not easily changed.  Hence there is a restriction in friendships and business opportunities."
 This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused.
" You dislike facing issues or witnessing hurt feelings.  You make friends easily but must guard against becoming involved in the affairs of others or being too easily led.  You could do well working with the public giving advice, where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  You find it difficult to make snap decisions and to occupy a leadership position as you lack self-confidence.  You dislike heavy manual work; as well, you are inclined to put plans off until forced to take action.  You find it difficult to be systematic in business and you dislike budgeting.  Without the encouragement of others, you lack the energy, confidence, or initiative required to bring an idea to fruition."
" Others can, at times, take advantage of your gentle nature."
" In some ways you are not overly emotional and sympathetic to others and can be shrewd and materialistic.  Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
" Difficulty in accepting advice or admitting that you may have made a mistake causes you to appear to be stubborn and set in your ways.  Thus, you have too often created the wrong impression, and friendships have suffered.  This name does offer creative talent where there is the opportunity for ingenuity and originality.  You have a tendency, at times, to have too many ideas on the go, and thus your efforts are scattered and many things do not reach completion.  You are inclined to do to excess the things you like to do.  You have very intense feelings and find it difficult to maintain stability and happiness.  If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
" You are attracted to working outdoors in nature, where you would experience the peace and serenity you so much desire.  You would find electricity, electronics, and similar technical fields of interest, as well as computer, mathematical, and scientific studies.  You are inclined to be quiet, reserved, patient, and conservative, preferring to test and prove everything to your own satisfaction before committing yourself.  You like to finish what you start without interruptions, and also to have everything in its place and properly organized.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative.  As a result, you seem aloof.  Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
" Scientific concepts appeal to you.  You like activities that require physical effort as well as mental ingenuity.  Your questioning, critical, practical nature makes you prove all ideas to your own satisfaction, rarely accepting  anyone's word or ideas.  At times you are torn between your desire for system and order and your desire for change and new experiences.  You have to guard against impatience and criticism of the weaknesses of others.  Your impulsive nature could lead to accidents."
" You sincerely like people and do not often experience loneliness; your work and home-life are likely filled with association   You enjoy music and could have a fine singing voice; however, the study could be somewhat difficult because you do not find it easy to apply yourself to concentrated study for long periods.  In this respect, this name is not altogether constructive; it creates a somewhat scattering influence which makes it difficult for you to finish what you start.  This name brings disappointments and emotional involvements through being too sympathetic and easily influenced."
" When on a schedule, you follow it implicitly. Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
"Physical weaknesses centre in the head.  The eyes, ears, teeth, or sinuses could be affected, or you could experience loss of hair.  Skin problems such as acne or eczema could also appear."
 You have to guard against impatience and criticism of the weaknesses of others.  Your impulsive nature could lead to accidents.
" However, in your personal life, this reserve and reticence are often mistaken for coldness and lack of feeling, with the result that others find it difficult to understand you.  While your name gives you a clever, deep mind, you feel and sense much that you do not fully understand. As it is not easy for you to share your deeper thoughts and ideals with others, you are inclined to choose the association of those few friends with whom you feel the most at ease and with whom you can enjoy companionship in a contemplative mood without feeling pressure for verbal communication."
" You are ambitious and practical and often look at things for their financial viability.  Fairness is important to you and you could be drawn to the justice system.   Personal relationships suffer sometimes because you are inclined to overlook the little things, such as thoughtful and appreciative gestures.   This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" This characteristic could make you rather unpopular with your associates.  Although you are very knowledgeable and intelligent, you often find spontaneous verbal expression difficult.  You crave friendship, understanding, love, and affection but your reserved manner appears forbidding to others.  You can give expression to your personal thoughts and feelings most fluently through the written word.  You have a sensitive nature--sensitive to your environment and particularly sensitive to how your deeper and more serious interests are regarded by others.  Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
" You naturally attract people with problems who seek your understanding and advice.  You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself.  You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence."
" Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts."
" Although this name is well balanced, if it is combined with a surname that is not harmonious, you would tend to worry and find it difficult to organize your efforts."
" You are good natured and affectionate and enjoy home and family life.  You tend to avoid issues, however, and put off until tomorrow decisions that should be made today.  For that reason, you would find difficulty in achieving success in positions requiring aggressiveness and quick decisions.  Your inclination is to pursue a line of work where you carry some level of responsibility and diplomacy is required in contact with people.  Others can, at times, take advantage of your gentle nature."
 A weakness of this name is a tendency to make promises which you have difficulty in keeping.  You tend to be lavish in your tastes and to spend your money freely.  You have a heart of gold and are always ready to give generously.
 This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition.
" You enjoy being with people in a social environment.  Your personal appearance is important to you, for you desire to make a good impression on others.  Your pleasant manner attracts people to you with their problems and you are capable of offering practical advice, though you would probably not follow such advice yourself.  This name causes you to be somewhat too concerned with the personalities, problems, and activities of other people.  You seem positive and decisive and can be outspoken in the expression of your opinions, but you lack the self-confidence needed to follow through with your ideas and plans.  Procrastination is your downfall.  You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition."
" You are pleasant and diplomatic, and seem to sense how others feel.  You could do well in public relations work.  You have a good business sense, but tend to procrastinate and get involved with people who could interfere with your carrying your endeavours to a proper close.  Although you have many good plans, can visualize their workings, and have the best of intentions, planning is often as far as you get.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  Your emotional nature at times does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, and you experience entanglements that could prove awkward and embarrassing."
" Your lack of patience and consistency in your affairs and your tendency to act impulsively can lead to actions you later regret taking, or to accidents, particularly to the head.  You find that you often do the hard, pioneering work in an undertaking, only to see others reap the benefits.  While this name makes you very honest and sincere in your personal relationships, your tendency to retaliate with caustic remarks over even slight offenses could spoil many friendships."
" You are kind and generous, and will fill a need when you see it; at times, others take advantage of your generosity. The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
" You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.  Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed."
" When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.  Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
" Your ambition is for the stability of settling down, with a nice home, good furniture, and a good standard of living.  You have the business ability and astuteness to attain this standard.  You desire to direct and control finances, both in business and in the home.  You would appreciate the cultural aspects of life such as art and music.  It tends to be too practical an influence causing you to put the practical needs of your home and family ahead of taking the time for the little considerations which create love and understanding.  This name creates a strong, capable nature, able to lead and control, of which you are probably well aware, but it causes a worrying nature.  It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
 You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed.
"Weaknesses in the health through the use of this name could affect the heart or bronchial area, or cause problems relative to the generative organs."
 You experience much misunderstanding and unhappiness in your personal life as a result.
" You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
" You could become frustrated and thwarted in your efforts if too many changes or disruptions occur.  Also, you do not appreciate people enforcing  new methods or ideas on you, as you like to examine all the details before making changes.  It is difficult for you to be spontaneous and affectionate with those close to you, as suitable words and actions do not come to mind quickly.  In association your tendency to state your mind simply and clearly, without diplomacy or finesse, can lead to awkwardness or embarrassment."
" There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
" Business success could be achieved, to a point, abut your personal life would suffer.  It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive."
" You are basically seeking truth in life and have a very analytical and questioning mind.  Being perceptive and intuitive, you often respond to your hunches, which can lead you into bitter experiences.  You love change, travel, and new opportunities and dislike monotonous detail.  Though you show enthusiasm over a new-found interest, you seldom finish the things you start.  If you are repressed or restricted in any way, you become frustrated, moody, and depressed.  You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness.  You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.  Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed."
" You enjoy working with your hands and can be resourceful and inventive along practical lines.  Being much focused on your pursuits, at times you overlook the personal considerations and attentions that create understanding and companionship with others.  This name causes you to suffer with self-consciousness in new situations and an inability to be diplomatic when situations warrant.  You are loyal in friendships and express candidly.   You enjoy outdoors activities with a few close friends."
" You are extremely analytical and sometimes critical of both others and of yourself, and must guard against sarcastic speech and temper.  At times you feel torn between your desire for system and order, and your need for change and new experiences.  You do not accept new ideas readily and do not appreciate unsolicited advice.  You tend to be impulsive and could attract accidents as a result."
" You want the best, but lack the confidence and aggressiveness to materialize your desires.  Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
" Your scholarly, studious interests incline you to art, literature, philosophy, music, and drama.  You wonder about the deeper aspects of life contained in religious theories and occult beliefs.  Others may consider you to be aloof and unemotional since you often find it difficult to express spontaneously.  They could interpret your quietness as disinterest and aloofness, for they do not realize the depth of your feelings and thoughts.  You require time alone, especially in the outdoors, to cope with the pressures of life."
" You have a few good friends who enjoy similar activities.  Living much within your own thoughts and finding it challenging to communicate easily with others, you are, at times, too candid and honest in your assessment of situations.  You feel this separation from others and would give anything to be always lighthearted and friendly instead of serious and shy."
" You shrink from sordidness and poverty because you feel very deeply for anyone in unfortunate circumstances.  Though you recognize your responsibilities, you are inclined to put things off until you are forced to take action.  If given the opportunity, you could develop musical and artistic abilities."
" This name gives a certain amount of practicality to your thinking; but there is also a tendency to scatter your efforts for, although you want system and order and stability in your life, you are too apt to be distracted from the job you are doing and to become involved in spontaneous interests.  You are good-natured, have a good sense of humour, and are fairly easy-going, making friends with those who enjoy a good time.  A weakness of this name is a tendency to make promises which you have difficulty in keeping.  You tend to be lavish in your tastes and to spend your money freely.  You have a heart of gold and are always ready to give generously."
" This name creates a nature that can be the life of the party, but many times you can become involved in emotional situations against your better judgment.  Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to."
" However, you do not know the meaning of relaxation, for when supposedly resting, your mind is forever active, planning out some new project or seeking new ways to improve your present enterprise.  You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself."
" Though you can work on any undertaking intently as long as it absorbs your interest, you cannot persevere when confronted by obstacles or by tedious monotony.  Thus your success in your undertakings is limited.  The tasks or activities you enjoy the most allow some form of creative or artistic expression.  You will never tolerate a situation where your independence and individuality are curtailed.  Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
" Although you are good-natured and never intend offence, still your blunt, direct, and candid manner of expression strains friendships; your honesty and sincerity earn respect from others.  You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others."
" Because you tend to be somewhat of a perfectionist, you might insist on doing too many things yourself instead of delegating jobs to others who might do less satisfactory work.  This name does make you quite direct and straight-to-the-point.  Your verbal expression does not reflect your inner thoughts and feelings, and you often wonder why people react to what you say.  The influence of this name does not promote the friendship that you desire or the relaxation and naturalness you should enjoy with people.  It is a name that makes you far too practical and serious-minded, and makes it difficult for you to act with spontaneity."
" Your infinite patience would allow you to develop intricate, involved skills to perfection.  However, it is not easy for others to work and live with you as you deliberate so long in arriving at conclusions and allow small details to restrict your point of view.  You often feel burdened with work, and worry abut details out of proportion to their importance.  This name has not allowed you to be spontaneous and responsive; you like to have time to think and plan your actions.  You tend to be dominated by lyour habits and dislike changing a pattern of living that is comfortable to you.  You have a traditional and conservative outlook in almost everything."
"You desire harmony and refinement in your environment and in all your personal associations. Although mentally quick and intuitive in recognizing the thoughts and feelings of others, you experience a lack of fluency in verbal expression in responding. Kind but shy, you appear calm but suffer inwardly from nervous tension that saps your strength.  As a result, you experience moods of depression and self-pity and often avoid facing issues. A lack of confidence leads to procrastination, a need for support and encouragement from others, and a vulnerability to be taken advantage of in many situations."
" You have a desire for association with people and, since you have no difficulty in being spontaneous and expressive with others, you have considerable ability for discussion and debate.  You enjoy unexpected opportunities for meeting people, or doing things on the spur of the moment.  Where you have difficulty is in organizing and systematizing the handling of your responsibilities.  Though you can work on any undertaking intently as long as it absorbs your interest, you cannot persevere when confronted by obstacles or by tedious monotony.  Thus your success in your undertakings is limited.  The tasks or activities you enjoy the most allow some form of creative or artistic expression.  You will never tolerate a situation where your independence and individuality are curtailed.  Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
" You are generous and people are drawn to you because of your friendly and sympathetic nature.  You lack system and order in your life and will often leave your own duties if someone calls upon you for assistance.  When you are inspired and feel happy, life seems so wonderful; but you can be just as depressed and unhappy as well, feeling as if everyone is against you."
" You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
" You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand and cannot express.  Your delight in mystery could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, uncontrolled thoughts make it difficult for you to retain emotional stability, and prevent you from finding proper peace and relaxation.  You tend to centre your interest too much on whatever means the most to you, and then you become over-possessive and suffer through disillusionment and fear of losses."
" Being much focused on your pursuits, at times you overlook the personal considerations and attentions that create understanding and companionship with others.  This name causes you to suffer with self-consciousness in new situations and an inability to be diplomatic when situations warrant.  You are loyal in friendships and express candidly.   You enjoy outdoors activities with a few close friends."
" As you are versatile and capable, you could do any job well, although you would not like to do menial tasks.  Having considerable vision, you could be adept at formulating new, more effective ways of doing things.  You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself.  You could work well in sales and promotion, and would not be afraid to risk a gamble as the name gives you much self-confidence.  You do not find contentment in the routine tasks and responsibilities that are associated with home and family or with administrative detail in the business world, so you have to guard against frustration and even moods of depression over your personal responsibilities.  The restlessness this name creates could find an outlet in caustic, irritable expression."
" You would work best in a relaxed environment at tasks involving writing, mathematical, or analytical skills that require concentration.  You appear calm to others, but at times you suffer inwardly with nervous tension.  You can find it difficult to express your deeper thoughts and feelings verbally.  It is much more natural for you to express your deeper thoughts in writing.  A lack of positivity and confidence is a source of difficulty in making decisions in business dealings.  You are easily offended, and can suffer with moods of depression.  You want the best, but lack the confidence and aggressiveness to materialize your desires.  Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
"Weaknesses in the health could affect the intestinal organs or cause glandular conditions.  Problems from head tension affecting the eyes, ears, sinuses, or teeth could arise.
"
" There are humanitarian ideals in this name, making you feel the urge to champion the cause of the downtrodden, the victims of circumstances and injustices.  However, it is difficult for you to materialize your ideals because of a restless, unsettled feeling which causes you never to know just what it is that you should be working toward, and the very intensity of your nature makes systematic concentration and application a challenge.  You can have intensely contrasting feelings toward people, either you are fiercely loyal or extremely intolerant.  There is rarely a happy medium in your feelings.  Consequently, you experience many disappointments in people, tragedy, and the loss of the very things for which you may be intensely striving.  Bitter experiences could make you cynical, critical, and argumentative.  You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation."
" You enjoy the out-of-doors and find your greatest peace and relaxation from the beauty and harmony of nature.  You prefer to limit your friendships and associations to those who share your interests and appreciate your quiet, refined ways.  Others often find it difficult to understand you.  Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" There is always an aloofness and reserve that acts as a barrier and prevents any close ties. You live much within your own thoughts, and seek relaxation away from people, out in nature, where you can ease the tensions of your life.  You find it difficult to express your true feelings, whether it be affection, appreciation, or tenderness, which play such an important part in creating a close bond within the family."
" The restlessness this name creates could find an outlet in caustic, irritable expression."
" Any jobs requiring systematic and conscientious effort, or involving any form of drudgery, dismay you.  In your work, you would seek a position offering self-expression through contact with people, such as sales or teaching, or a position giving scope to your creative, artistic talents.  You are good-natured and likeable, and people tend to confide in you and seek your advice in personal problems.  Others sense your sincere interest and desire to help, and you can always be counted on to see the bright side of any problem.  You enjoy making others happy and you never let your own problems ""get you down"" for any length of time, even though you do tend to worry too much at times.  Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.  In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" You stick stubbornly to your ideas or decisions, in spite of any appeals or advice; you are not willing to accept a compromise.  You prefer to be alone with your own thoughts, rather than in the company of others.  This name restricts spontaneity in association and the fluency of your verbal expression.  When you are required to express yourself in personal matters requiring finesse and diplomacy, you feel awkward and embarrassed.  Although you realize perfectly well what is expected of you, you are unable to find the right words, and hence you end up saying something inappropriate in a candid way.  You can express your deeper thoughts and feelings best through writing.  Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.  You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
 You feel this separation from others and would give anything to be always lighthearted and friendly instead of serious and shy.
" People often disappoint you because you are idealistic and are apt to place those whom you admire on a pedestal.  Then you become disillusioned when they fall short of your expectations.  You are quick mentally and like to see things moving at an accelerated pace.  Patience is not one of your virtues; you want to move when the impulse strikes you.  While such spontaneity is fine at times, you must take account of conditions and employ careful analysis so as to avoid disastrous results such as accidents due to hasty actions.  Most things you do, you do well, but as soon as the task, hobby, or job becomes familiar or routine, you are bored and crave a change.  Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" It limits you to practical matters of the day, filling your life with detailed routine. hard work, and monotony."
" This name has allowed you to develop depth and breadth of mind.  You are able to retain facts, to grasp new information to your existing store of knowledge.  You never seem to be out of your depth of understanding.  For these reasons others who may not have the same quickness of mind classify you as a ""know it all"" and, although you may be highly respected, this characteristic is unlikely to endear you to your associates.  You have a very responsible nature, are capable and mature, and are willing to assume a position as a pillar of the community."
"You would be affected in the health through a sensitive solar plexus and nervous system.  Nervous disorders, nervous indigestion, and stomach ulcers could develop."
"You are too fond of sugars and starches, thus you could have a weakness in your liver, kidneys, or skin, creating pimples or eczema.  While this name gives you a wonderful personality, and attracts much love and friendship, it is far too emotional and scattering an influence and will not allow the material accumulation nor personal happiness you should have.
"
" You can be lifted by beauty in all forms and are at the most creative when inspired.  Your expressive, affectionate nature responds quickly through your feelings, but you must guard against being possessive and jealous.  Your delight in mystery and your sensitivity to things you do not understand could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, it is difficult for you to retain emotional stability, for you can easily swing into moods of depression and self-pity.  Your quick temper can flare up suddenly and be over as suddenly, leaving you very sorry for any suffering you have caused."
"This name would cause tension affecting the eyes, teeth, sinuses, ears or throat.  There could also be a sensitivity in the heart, lungs, and respiratory organs, and frequent headaches."
"You could experience sensitivity in the heart, lungs, or bronchial area, causing tuberculosis, asthma, or depletion of your energies."
" This name inclines you to be sympathetic and generous to those in difficult or unfortunate circumstances.  You can be firm, positive, and independent in your own ideas and in reaching your own decisions, yet when it comes to taking action or following things through to completion, you often need encouragement.  You respond quickly to kind words or any appreciation shown you.  There are artistic, creative abilities in this name that you could express through music or singing, or, in a practical way, through sewing or interior decorating.  You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature.  In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
" You express your thoughts and feelings best through writing rather than verbally.  In fact, others find it challenging to understand you as you do not reveal your innermost thoughts unless you are completely comfortable in your friendships.  For that reason, despite having good business abilities, you like to work alone or where you are making your own decisions.  It has created separateness from others and loneliness in your life."
" In a position dealing with the public, you could do well because of your friendly personality, interest in people, and desire to please.  When asked, you are able to give others good advice that you would probably not follow yourself, but must guard against being too opinionated in controversial matters."
" While you find it easy to meet and mix, and can appear agreeable and compromising in conversation, you can become dogmatic and forceful if pressed too far.  Others learn that you cannot be told what to do and you seldom change your mind once it is made up.  You prefer situations that allow a degree of independence, but are reluctant to take on a demanding work-load or responsibility.  In a position dealing with the public, you could do well because of your friendly personality, interest in people, and desire to please.  When asked, you are able to give others good advice that you would probably not follow yourself, but must guard against being too opinionated in controversial matters."
Health weaknesses centre in the generative organs or appear as general nervous tension. 
Use of this name would cause any health weaknesses to centre in the female generative organs.
"This name gives you ambition, high ideals, and much creative ability, but the intense dynamic nature is too often spent in feelings and in moods, rather than in constructive action.  You desire to be your own boss, yet you find it difficult to stabilize your life and to settle down and be accumulative.  Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.  You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" You always wonder if you are doing the right thing, desiring to express yourself but afraid to.  People may consider you haughty and aloof because of your sensitivity and reserved ways.  You may find some expression abut it would usually be light conversation, rarely daring to reveal your deeper thoughts or take others into your confidence for fear of criticism or ridicule.  You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
 You want to make money in easier ways than through arduous work.
 Your spirits are buoyed up greatly by encouragement and appreciation.  There is a tendency to be scattering in your efforts and you prefer to avoid menial jobs of a routine and repetitive nature.  You are inclined to pursue good times and emotional indulgences to excess.
" If given the opportunity, you could develop musical and artistic abilities."
" It causes you to be too serious, and interferes with happiness and relaxation that comes with naturalness of expression."
" You wonder about the deeper aspects of life contained in religious theories and occult beliefs.  Others may consider you to be aloof and unemotional since you often find it difficult to express spontaneously.  They could interpret your quietness as disinterest and aloofness, for they do not realize the depth of your feelings and thoughts.  You require time alone, especially in the outdoors, to cope with the pressures of life."
" In all your work and activities you are inclined to be rather unsystematic and disorderly.  These characteristics spoil stability, progress, and accumulation, even though you may put forth intense effort.  Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life."
" You work best alone, making your own decisions, and learning from your own experiences.  Despite your loyalty to friends, your communication at times is stilted, too candid, and frank."
" You must be careful not to become possessive and jealous of those close to you, however, as you could attract losses and unfortunate experiences.  If you attach an ideal of service to your life, you could find great happiness and could express a very beautiful, happy, responsible, artistic, and generous nature."
" It is a name that makes you far too practical and serious-minded, and makes it difficult for you to act with spontaneity."
" You can be deliberate to a fault.  Your over-cautious nature allows many promising opportunities to slip by.  Conserving finances and material possessions, you maintain your home at a good standard, and treat all family responsibility seriously.  Though reserved in showing affection you are a considerate person."
" However, there is a tendency to assume too heavy a burden of responsibility for others, which leads to worry and undue concern.  People with problems are drawn to you as they recognize you as one who has understanding and gives not only sympathy and comfort but provides also some constructive advice or assistance.  You have a generous quality to your nature, but you must guard carefully against giving more than you receive or you will find yourself doing without because you have helped someone else.  You love people, family, home, and friends and try to be a parent to the whole human race.  While you have generally stable conditions in your personal life, you may experience some problems in business affairs through a tendency to be scattering and inattentive to details."
 Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed.
" While you lack verbal expression and spontaneity under this name, you have a natural literary ability and writing comes easily to you.  You also have a deep appreciation of nature and all the finer things in life."
"You could experience sensitivity in your heart, lungs, and bronchial area, and also suffer from constipation or other ailments affecting the intestinal tract."
" You are deeply moved by the beauties of life, especially nature.  Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next.  Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" When your interest is exhausted, you switch to something else even though it means leaving your undertakings unfinished.  This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  This skepticism has not protected you from many disappointments when people you have trusted have let you down."
" You sense and feel much that you do not understand, and sometimes you are alarmed at your thoughts and wonder about their origin.  You rarely experience the tranquility that comes with stability of thinking or emotional control.  At times, you are very inspired, desiring to be with people and to entertain others as the ""life of the party,"" while at other times you are aloof and choose to remove yourself entirely from association.  You crave understanding and affection but your intensity of desire and your self-consciousness prevent you from finding the happiness you desire.  You have suffered many disappointments and misunderstandings because of your inability to express your inner thoughts."
" You are quick-minded and have the freedom of expression to mix easily with people.  Because your feelings and desires are so changeable, you are never satisfied with conditions as they are.  You have many ideas, plans, and ambitions, but too often they are for an easy way out of a difficulty or an easy way of making money.  You seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.   You find it difficult to systematize your efforts and to fulfil your obligations and plans as you are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job to reach your goals.  Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power.  This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people.  The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
" As you respond to love and encouragement from others, your romantic and dreamy nature can easily lead you into love affairs.  Your desire for peace at any price can result in going out of your way to avoid arguments and confrontation or hurting the feelings of others.  Also, budgeting can be a problem as you enjoy spending money and can easily ignore being practical."
" You feel impelled by intense desires that you cannot comprehend or satisfy.  You have had the desire to accomplish something outstanding and to do something very worthwhile for humanity, especially early in your life. This name gives you a versatile, clever, analytical mind, but unfortunately you cannot direct your interest toward an undertaking for long, as you do not have the patience and practicality for systematic hard work and attention to detail.  You resent obstacles, delays, and restrictions. This name gives you ambition, high ideals, and much creative ability, but the intense dynamic nature is too often spent in feelings and in moods, rather than in constructive action.  You desire to be your own boss, yet you find it difficult to stabilize your life and to settle down and be accumulative.  Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.  You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" Reacting against injustice, you go out of your way to assist in creating fairness.  You are very creative and promotional, and work intensely to carry out your plans.  Though you have limitless enthusiasm for new ventures, you lose interest quickly once things become routine, as you dislike being forced to attend to detail and do monotonous work.  Your lack of patience and consistency in your affairs and your tendency to act impulsively can lead to actions you later regret taking, or to accidents, particularly to the head.  You find that you often do the hard, pioneering work in an undertaking, only to see others reap the benefits.  While this name makes you very honest and sincere in your personal relationships, your tendency to retaliate with caustic remarks over even slight offenses could spoil many friendships."
"Your intense, restless nature can bring on tension which affects the solar plexus and digestion, or the generative organs."
"Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts.  Nervous tension centres in the solar plexus, with nervous indigestion and stomach ulcers a possible result."
 Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships.
"This name creates a weakness in the heart, lungs, and bronchial area, and could cause heart trouble, pneumonia, asthma, or tuberculosis.  It also creates tension in the nervous system, particularly the solar plexus and stomach, causing nervous indigestion and relative conditions."
" You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
"Tension could cause nervous disorders, or centre in the head bringing weaknesses in the eyes, ears, sinuses, or teeth."
" This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" You will do your utmost to help others in need, despite inconvenience or even hardship to yourself.  You are affectionate, and respond quickly to appreciation.  As a child you were expressive.  An imaginative, impressionable person, you could excel in the theatre as a dramatist or comedienne, and the enjoyment and appreciation of your audience would be your greatest inspiration.  Fine as your nature is at times the power of your feelings is difficult to control as it unleashes itself through outbursts of temper.  The name does not engender emotional stability; nor have you the system and order in your thinking always to finish what you start.  Scattering of efforts interferes with success in your undertakings."
" You cannot stand pressure and desire to work where there is no confusion.  This name restricts proper verbal expression; as a result, you are often lonely, craving understanding of others.  Yours is a very deep, reflective nature, but others would never know it as you keep your deeper feelings within."
Over-indulgence in food or emotional desires could cause you to have problems in your nervous system as well as with your skin.
Your health could be affected by disorders affecting the intestinal tract.
"Weaknesses in your health affect the senses of the head, causing eye, ear or sinus trouble and the generative organs."
" You are a very patient person and will work hard one step at a time to accomplish your goals.  Not interested in large undertakings, you are content to live from day to day to save for your future.  Always budgeting carefully, you do not believe in frivolous spending.  You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but you are not especially imaginative or investigative.  You are particular and quite set in your way you want things to be done.  Once you have made up your mind or formed an opinion it is not easily changed.  Hence there is a restriction in friendships and business opportunities."
" You enjoy working at anything of a mechanical or technical nature, and believe that what is worth doing is worth doing well.  When you are interested in a project, you concentrate all your thoughts on it and do not appreciate being interrupted.  This name creates a deliberate and methodical way of thinking and speaking; it takes you time to learn but, once you have mastered a subject, you do not forget it.  You are very systematic in all you do and do not like to see things out of order; however, there is a tendency for you to be too fussy.  There is a seriousness to your nature which could cause you to worry over your responsibilities, especially when confronted with change and uncertainty."
 You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature.
" It is difficult for you to be spontaneous and affectionate with those close to you, as suitable words and actions do not come to mind quickly.  In association your tendency to state your mind simply and clearly, without diplomacy or finesse, can lead to awkwardness or embarrassment."
" Although you have many creative, original ideas, procrastination is your worst enemy because you can seldom make decisions and carry them out.  In your desire to gain the favour of others and to keep peace, because you abhor friction, you change your opinion to agree with those at hand.  It is easy for you to express love and affection, but you would have to watch that your emotional nature does not get the better of you and lead you to indiscretions which you would later regret."
 You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation.
 You budget carefully and do not believe in frivolous spending.  You appreciate a settled home environment that permits you to show your love for friends and family through what you do for them rather than having to express your feelings in words.  Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail.
 Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations.
" You could work well in sales and promotion, and would not be afraid to risk a gamble as the name gives you much self-confidence.  You do not find contentment in the routine tasks and responsibilities that are associated with home and family or with administrative detail in the business world, so you have to guard against frustration and even moods of depression over your personal responsibilities.  The restlessness this name creates could find an outlet in caustic, irritable expression."
" With increased familiarity you are inclined to speak your mind in a forthright, sometimes argumentative manner which creates annoyance and often hard feelings.  In an argument, you usually emerge victor, but at a cost.  This name does not offer the softness of expression for long-lasting compatibility in close associations."
" Being analytical and naturally studious, you are interested in a factual understanding of the mysteries of life.  Your methodical nature requires that you like to finish what you start without interruptions and also to have everything in its place and properly organized.  An ability to concentrate could take you into computer programming or accountancy or any work requiring concentration and attention to detail.  You have, also, a flair for creative expression with your hands.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing much turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in conversation with those with whom you are not well-acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative with new acquaintances or in a large crowd.  As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly.  You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
"This name is a fairly healthy influence, although it does not give you as much vitality as many people have.  Any tension centres in the fluid functions causing overweight, varicose veins, swelling of the legs and ankles, kidney trouble, bladder trouble, or female problems."
" You appreciate music, art, and drama and, if given training, could excel in those fields.  Self-consciousness may prevent you from feeling at ease in positions of impromptu expression.  Desiring to be free from detail and monotony, you find it difficult to finish what you start if it does not hold your interest.  You enjoy reading and the beauties of nature, experiencing peace and relaxation in outdoor activities.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  With acquaintances and strangers, you tend to be reticent and reserved.  Your friends never know whether they will find you friendly and charming or lost in introspection.  When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" You are intrigued by a challenge, especially in mechanical and technical fields.  Scientific concepts appeal to you.  You like activities that require physical effort as well as mental ingenuity.  Your questioning, critical, practical nature makes you prove all ideas to your own satisfaction, rarely accepting  anyone's word or ideas.  At times you are torn between your desire for system and order and your desire for change and new experiences.  You have to guard against impatience and criticism of the weaknesses of others.  Your impulsive nature could lead to accidents."
" Position and means are important to you and, in order to create this impression of affluence, you will spend even when it is not prudent to do so.  You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.  You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
" Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents.  Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts."
" You appreciate home and settled conditions and take on a lot of responsibility to ensure that your home life functions efficiently.  This name restricts the innate expression of an artistic, musical nature."
" This name restricts the innate expression of an artistic, musical nature."
 Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed.
" You can then become intolerant of others, and caustic and belittling in your expression, thereby imposing stress on your personal relationships.  Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents."
" Physical weaknesses resulting from the use of this name centre in the heart and respiratory organs, or in the fluid functions."
" You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
The health weaknesses created by this name affect the fluid functions.
"You are inclined to indulge in rich foods that lack proper nourishment.  This name creates weaknesses in the heart, the respiratory organs, or the kidneys."
" You gravitate to positions where there is stability, security and opportunities to work with others to make steady progress.  You could be very skilful in dealing with technical and mechanical matters.  You appreciate details, precision, and system and order.  These qualities, however, can make you too fussy, from time to time, over inconsequential matters.  You do not take to changes easily and can be quietly stubborn.  You do rely on the support and encouragement of others as there is an underlying lack of confidence with this name. For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions."
" Difficulty in expression results in your being too positive, blunt, and candid in speech and although you are easily offended by others, you do not show it.  You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof.  The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
" Although you may appear confident and positive, you actually lack confidence and feel self-conscious at times.  This name spoils patience and depth of thought, and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence."
" When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" You suffer inner turmoil and moods at times especially when you feel misunderstood, and being extremely sensitive, you are easily hurt and offended.  Your quiet intensity is difficult for others to understand and thus, you are on guard for fear of being ridiculed or criticized.  Loving the outdoors, you enjoy outside activities and the beauty of nature in its many facets.  Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets."
"This name is not conducive to good health, and tends to engender the desire for heavy foods, for example, excessive protein and carbohydrates.  You could suffer with problems relative to the fluid functions or intestinal tract, swelling of the legs and ankles, or over-stoutness."
" An extremely independent and self-sufficient person, you dislike taking orders or advice from anyone.  You believe in speaking directly and to the point, so you are candid and abrupt.  Many friendships are lost because of your directness.  Those in close association complain that you are not inclined to observe and return acts of kindness, compassion, or affection.  You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
" You are quick mentally and like to see things moving at an accelerated pace.  Patience is not one of your virtues; you want to move when the impulse strikes you.  While such spontaneity is fine at times, you must take account of conditions and employ careful analysis so as to avoid disastrous results such as accidents due to hasty actions.  Most things you do, you do well, but as soon as the task, hobby, or job becomes familiar or routine, you are bored and crave a change.  Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" It fires you with ambition and promotional ideas, ideas that are original, progressive, and large-scale.  With this name, success to you is a foregone conclusion, for you cannot conceive any reason for not reaching all your goals, as you have self-sufficiency, supreme confidence, boundless energy, and enthusiasm.  As long as you have a sense of freedom from monotony and drudgery, and can see progress being made, you feel buoyant and optimistic.  However, obstacles and frustration can give rise to feelings of impatience, intolerance, and depression.  The ever-present desire to progress does not allow you proper relaxation or the proper expression of the softer feminine qualities of sympathy, encouragement, and affection.  Others may see you as rather shrewd and calculating."
" This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  This skepticism has not protected you from many disappointments when people you have trusted have let you down."
 You have good business judgment but lack the confidence to carry out your own ideas unless assisted by an associate.
" However, you tend to put things off and avoid facing issues because of a lack of confidence and uncertainty.  You often need encouragement from someone before you can come to a decision."
" You have the analysis, vision, and promotional ability to make progress.  You could achieve heights of success in business, but there is also a factor which brings many forced changes and friction with people, which in turn offsets the success you could achieve.  The more sensitive types of people find you overpowering at times.  You tend to have too many irons in the fire and fail to complete your undertakings satisfactorily.  Business success could be achieved, to a point, abut your personal life would suffer.  It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive."
" Because of the serious, responsible qualities of your name, you must recognize the importance of a sense of humour and optimistic perspective of life.  In some ways you are not overly emotional and sympathetic to others and can be shrewd and materialistic.  Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
" You desire change and varied experiences and you are capable in many areas, but you do not excel because of your scattering, impulsive desires.  With supportive influence from other names you may use, you could be creative or artistic in a practical way, but basically this name is a plodding influence, though you have a desire for greater expression.  Although you desire to avoid monotony, you seem to be attuned to system, order, and attention to detail.  You can be very analytical, exacting, and patient as long as there is a challenge holding your interest, such as in the field of computers with its technical challenge.  When your interest is exhausted, you switch to something else even though it means leaving your undertakings unfinished.  This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  This skepticism has not protected you from many disappointments when people you have trusted have let you down."
" Your inclination is to pursue a line of work where you carry some level of responsibility and diplomacy is required in contact with people.  Others can, at times, take advantage of your gentle nature."
" You appear calm to others, but at times you suffer inwardly with nervous tension.  You can find it difficult to express your deeper thoughts and feelings verbally.  It is much more natural for you to express your deeper thoughts in writing.  A lack of positivity and confidence is a source of difficulty in making decisions in business dealings.  You are easily offended, and can suffer with moods of depression.  You want the best, but lack the confidence and aggressiveness to materialize your desires.  Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
" You have imagination and many ideas but lack the ambition and drive necessary to accomplish your undertakings.  Many times you dream about the things you desire in life, but when it comes down to putting forth the necessary effort and accomplishing your goals, you do not have the strength and initiative.  This name does not allow you the system and order your life requires to run in a smooth, efficient way, and if possible you will avoid having to make decisions because you feel much more secure when you can lean on others.  Many times you make promises you do not keep, although your intentions are always good."
" Generally you are good-natured, though at times you can be blunt and sarcastic.   As you are naturally talkative, you find it easy to meet and make friends with many people.  This name inclines you to be sympathetic and generous to those in difficult or unfortunate circumstances.  You can be firm, positive, and independent in your own ideas and in reaching your own decisions, yet when it comes to taking action or following things through to completion, you often need encouragement.  You respond quickly to kind words or any appreciation shown you.  There are artistic, creative abilities in this name that you could express through music or singing, or, in a practical way, through sewing or interior decorating.  You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature.  In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
" For these reasons others who may not have the same quickness of mind classify you as a ""know it all"" and, although you may be highly respected, this characteristic is unlikely to endear you to your associates.  You have a very responsible nature, are capable and mature, and are willing to assume a position as a pillar of the community."
" Although you are very knowledgeable and intelligent, you often find spontaneous verbal expression difficult.  You crave friendship, understanding, love, and affection but your reserved manner appears forbidding to others.  You can give expression to your personal thoughts and feelings most fluently through the written word.  You have a sensitive nature--sensitive to your environment and particularly sensitive to how your deeper and more serious interests are regarded by others.  Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
" You resist change until you have examined an idea in detail and all facts fall into place for you.  You can be deliberate to a fault.  Your over-cautious nature allows many promising opportunities to slip by.  Conserving finances and material possessions, you maintain your home at a good standard, and treat all family responsibility seriously.  Though reserved in showing affection you are a considerate person."
" Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power.  This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people.  The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
 Fine as your nature is at times the power of your feelings is difficult to control as it unleashes itself through outbursts of temper.  The name does not engender emotional stability; nor have you the system and order in your thinking always to finish what you start.  Scattering of efforts interferes with success in your undertakings.
" You resist changes until you have examined an idea in detail and until all facts fall into place.  If you have to make a change, it is not easy to do so happily.  You do not readily change your ideas unless you are thoroughly convinced that you must."
" You desire the best and want to be successful and financially prosperous and are willing to give practical help where it is deserved.  You are ambitious and practical and often look at things for their financial viability.  Fairness is important to you and you could be drawn to the justice system.   Personal relationships suffer sometimes because you are inclined to overlook the little things, such as thoughtful and appreciative gestures.   This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
 Once you have made up your mind or formed an opinion it is not easily changed.  Hence there is a restriction in friendships and business opportunities.
" These qualities, however, can make you too fussy, from time to time, over inconsequential matters.  You do not take to changes easily and can be quietly stubborn.  You do rely on the support and encouragement of others as there is an underlying lack of confidence with this name. For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions."
" You would be happiest in positions where you are free to express individually and creatively and where opportunities are not restricted; you desire freedom, and do not tolerate being possessed by others.  You appreciate change and travel, and the opportunity to meet and mix with others, and to influence them with your creative ideas.  You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses and bitter experiences.  This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association."
"Any weakness in your health would show in your intestinal tract and related difficulties, over-stoutness, or rheumatism, although this name creates a fairly healthy nature."
" You are determined and deliberate in pursuing your ambitions, but you must work at your own speed. You hate to be hurried or to leave anything unfinished or untidy.  Your infinite patience would allow you to develop intricate, involved skills to perfection. Often feeling burdened with work, you worry about details out of proportion to their importance.  Having definite ideas, you are skeptical and do not change easily, for you require proof, preferably in complete detail before you will alter an opinion.  Once you are settled into a situation, you do not like to move or make changes.  When on a schedule, you follow it implicitly. Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
" The use of this name makes it extremely difficult to carry through and finish the things you start.  It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.  You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" You could do well in the sales field.  You are ambitious, desire the best in life, and appreciate quality in all things. You are creative, promotional, and versatile, all qualities leading to success in the financial side of your life.  However, this name has made you rather aggressive, shrewd, and critical and has caused you to be extremely independent.  It is difficult for you to express fully the softer, more feminine qualities that should be a part of your nature.  This name creates such a strong, positive nature, that the more sensitive types of people would find it overpowering at times."
 Your positive manner and outlook can make others feel that you are imposing your will on them and even interfering in their affairs.
" Most things you do, you do well, but as soon as the task, hobby, or job becomes familiar or routine, you are bored and crave a change.  Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" If these qualities are not understood and properly directed through music, art, or other creative expression, you could become jealous and possessive of those close to you.  Your feelings are so strong that you are inclined to build your life around certain individuals and become wrapped up in personal love rather than seeking into the deeper truths of life; thus you could suffer losses in your affections and shattered ideals.  You are generous and people are drawn to you because of your friendly and sympathetic nature.  You lack system and order in your life and will often leave your own duties if someone calls upon you for assistance.  When you are inspired and feel happy, life seems so wonderful; but you can be just as depressed and unhappy as well, feeling as if everyone is against you."
" You are a capable leader and organizer who should never be in a subordinate position.  You have the ability to organize and see the whole picture where any prospective business venture is concerned.  It is a name, however, which almost destroys the finer, sensitive qualities that should be expressed.  It makes spontaneous, natural expression difficult.  Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs."
" Personal contacts are important to you.  In situations where you are serving others, demonstrating or instructing, you have the patience to go into details that someone else may not think to be important.  In your association with others, you are often limited to the more mundane happenings and little personal problems that can be so frustrating to those of an active, dynamic nature.  You desire to create system and order in your environment but are inclined to become side-tracked and socialize when you should be working.  Your ambitions are not large, as you lack confidence in your own abilities and would sooner not take a chance.  You are often at odds with yourself, knowing what you should do, but finding it hard to find the initiative and will power to do it.  Liking to plan and think ahead, you do not act impulsively and do not like to have your plans or routine interfered with. You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
" You desire a settled home and family life, and are expressive and attentive to your loved ones.  You must be careful not to become possessive and jealous of those close to you, however, as you could attract losses and unfortunate experiences.  If you attach an ideal of service to your life, you could find great happiness and could express a very beautiful, happy, responsible, artistic, and generous nature."
" You have the ability to create a favourable first impression, and so you could do well in the fields of sales promotion or entertainment.  The use of this name creates a lack of stability in your affairs as it inclines you to procrastinate.  It spoils patience and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are inclined to do whatever is expedient in order to avoid facing issues.  You could suffer bitter experiences through attracting wrong types of association and can be drawn into circumstances involving you in unwise situations."
" This name has given you an interest in people and a desire for new experiences.  You have the ability to create a favourable first impression, and so you could do well in the fields of sales promotion or entertainment.  The use of this name creates a lack of stability in your affairs as it inclines you to procrastinate.  It spoils patience and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are inclined to do whatever is expedient in order to avoid facing issues.  You could suffer bitter experiences through attracting wrong types of association and can be drawn into circumstances involving you in unwise situations."
 You find it easy to converse with all types of people.  Your desire to possess and direct those closest to you could result in shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships.
 It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition.
" You can be lifted by beauty in all forms and you are at the most creative when inspired.  Your expressive, affectionate nature responds very quickly through your feelings, but you must guard against being possessive and jealous.  You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand and cannot express.  Your delight in mystery could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, uncontrolled thoughts make it difficult for you to retain emotional stability, and prevent you from finding proper peace and relaxation.  You tend to centre your interest too much on whatever means the most to you, and then you become over-possessive and suffer through disillusionment and fear of losses."
" However, it is not easy for others to work and live with you as you deliberate so long in arriving at conclusions and allow small details to restrict your point of view.  You often feel burdened with work, and worry abut details out of proportion to their importance.  This name has not allowed you to be spontaneous and responsive; you like to have time to think and plan your actions.  You tend to be dominated by lyour habits and dislike changing a pattern of living that is comfortable to you.  You have a traditional and conservative outlook in almost everything."
"Tension resulting from the use of this name would affect the heart, lungs, and respiratory organs, or the nervous system. "
" Others may consider you to be aloof and unemotional since you often find it difficult to express spontaneously.  They could interpret your quietness as disinterest and aloofness, for they do not realize the depth of your feelings and thoughts.  You require time alone, especially in the outdoors, to cope with the pressures of life."
" You may find some expression abut it would usually be light conversation, rarely daring to reveal your deeper thoughts or take others into your confidence for fear of criticism or ridicule.  You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
Weaknesses in the health could affect the intestinal tract with constipation and related difficulties such as rheumatism or arthritis.
" You have the ability to be an excellent homemaker and mother, or a teacher, as you appreciate people and know how to make them feel at ease, but you are inclined to worry over your responsibilities.  You enjoy a daily routine and settled conditions, once you have found a comfortable niche in life.  You resist changes until you have examined an idea in detail and until all facts fall into place.  If you have to make a change, it is not easy to do so happily.  You do not readily change your ideas unless you are thoroughly convinced that you must."
" However, it is difficult for you to materialize your ideals because of a restless, unsettled feeling which causes you never to know just what it is that you should be working toward, and the very intensity of your nature makes systematic concentration and application a challenge.  You can have intensely contrasting feelings toward people, either you are fiercely loyal or extremely intolerant.  There is rarely a happy medium in your feelings.  Consequently, you experience many disappointments in people, tragedy, and the loss of the very things for which you may be intensely striving.  Bitter experiences could make you cynical, critical, and argumentative.  You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation."
Sensitivity in your nervous system could cause you to suffer nervous conditions.
" You often become involved in situations without any thought of the consequences.  You are basically seeking truth in life and have a very analytical and questioning mind.  Being perceptive and intuitive, you often respond to your hunches, which can lead you into bitter experiences.  You love change, travel, and new opportunities and dislike monotonous detail.  Though you show enthusiasm over a new-found interest, you seldom finish the things you start.  If you are repressed or restricted in any way, you become frustrated, moody, and depressed.  You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" You desire change and travel and would enjoy opportunities that allowed you to be creative and to act independently, rather than to conform to system and routine.  However, this name does not allow you to complete your undertakings, as farther fields always look greener.  Although you may appear confident and positive, you actually lack confidence and feel self-conscious at times.  This name spoils patience and depth of thought, and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence."
" You are responsible and generous, although somewhat scattering and disorganized at times.  Any jobs requiring systematic and conscientious effort, or involving any form of drudgery, dismay you.  In your work, you would seek a position offering self-expression through contact with people, such as sales or teaching, or a position giving scope to your creative, artistic talents.  You are good-natured and likeable, and people tend to confide in you and seek your advice in personal problems.  Others sense your sincere interest and desire to help, and you can always be counted on to see the bright side of any problem.  You enjoy making others happy and you never let your own problems ""get you down"" for any length of time, even though you do tend to worry too much at times.  Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.  In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" Too idealistic and impractical through the use of this name, you would not find it easy to make a success in the business world.  You are inclined to procrastinate and let things slide and to make promises that you find difficult to fulfil although you have the best of intentions."
" You are efficient, and capable of carrying a lot of responsibility, but your nature is so serious that personal association suffers.  You demand as much from others as you do from yourself.  It is difficult for you to merge your nature with others to create understanding, or to show love and tenderness to those close to you.  You experience much misunderstanding and unhappiness in your personal life as a result."
" You are self-expressive, philanthropic, clever, and ambitious.  You like to specialize in whatever you undertake.  This name gives you an optimistic outlook on life.  You appreciate good quality in all things and want the best money can buy.  You have big ideals and dreams about the things you would like but you are not always willing to put forth the necessary effort, particularly if it means being subservient to others or having to work in an unimportant, menial capacity.  Position and means are important to you and, in order to create this impression of affluence, you will spend even when it is not prudent to do so.  You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.  You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
" You like to finish what you start without interruptions, and also to have everything in its place and properly organized.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative.  As a result, you seem aloof.  Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
"Health weakness centres in the fluid functions:  the kidneys, bladder, or bloodstream.  Tension could also cause you to suffer with female problems.
"
" Although you realize perfectly well what is expected of you, you are unable to find the right words, and hence you end up saying something inappropriate in a candid way.  You can express your deeper thoughts and feelings best through writing.  Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.  You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
" You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.  You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
" You have a deep, artistic, and creative side which shows through a love for music and literature.  Writing is a more natural mode of expression for your deeper thoughts and feelings than the spoken word.  You have an ability to concentrate and work intently on anything which holds your interest.  However, you prefer to avoid routine, monotony, and menial tasks.  You enjoy the out-of-doors and find your greatest peace and relaxation from the beauty and harmony of nature.  You prefer to limit your friendships and associations to those who share your interests and appreciate your quiet, refined ways.  Others often find it difficult to understand you.  Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
" Your driving, seeking nature and intensity of feelings could cause you to experience nervous breakdowns, nervous problems, fits, goitre, or a weak and sensitive solar plexus.  An impulsiveness could cause you to be accident prone.
"
" You have an appreciation for music and art, and could express along these lines."
" You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" You are very idealistic and romantic within yourself and may have tried to express your beautiful thoughts through poetry or writing.  Crudeness and vulgarity are very repulsive to you and you are very particular about little things.  You suffer greatly with lack of confidence and self-consciousness.  You crave affection and understanding, yet because you can be so easily and deeply hurt, you have learned to keep your true nature hidden; therefore people do not really know you.  You always wonder if you are doing the right thing, desiring to express yourself but afraid to.  People may consider you haughty and aloof because of your sensitivity and reserved ways.  You may find some expression abut it would usually be light conversation, rarely daring to reveal your deeper thoughts or take others into your confidence for fear of criticism or ridicule.  You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
" You are capable and clever and would excel in executive positions.  As you are a private person, it is a challenge for others to get to know and understand you. Your reticence has caused you to suffer aloneness and misunderstandings.  You would like to be easy-going and spontaneous but it does not come easily.  You can express yourself better through writing than verbally.  The mysteries of life appeal to you in your search for an understanding of the greater picture of life.  You love to read and can develop great powers of concentration."
"You have many disappointments because of extending a helping hand to others in need, and then not receiving any acknowledgement or reciprocation for your generosity.  After each experience, you have to guard against feelings of despondency and self-pity. You have high goals and ideals, but must incorporate more practicality, system, and concentration in order to materialize them."
"This name creates an intensity which could affect your stomach or create tension in the solar plexus, stomach, and generative organs."
" You lack system and order in your life and will often leave your own duties if someone calls upon you for assistance.  When you are inspired and feel happy, life seems so wonderful; but you can be just as depressed and unhappy as well, feeling as if everyone is against you."
" You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood."
" When your interests or curiosity are aroused, you work intensely at new undertakings, but your interests often wane when you encounter drudgery and monotony, with the result that you leave many things unfinished.  Your name has taken you into many bitter experiences.  The greatest lack in your life is stability and peace of mind.  A peaceful and quiet environment, especially out in nature, is one of your greatest desires, but you are constantly taken into chaotic conditions.  Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness.  You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.  Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed."
" Many times you make promises you do not keep, although your intentions are always good."
" It is difficult for you to express fully the softer, more feminine qualities that should be a part of your nature.  This name creates such a strong, positive nature, that the more sensitive types of people would find it overpowering at times."
" As you have modest ambitions, you are content to live from day to day and to save for your future.  You budget carefully and do not believe in frivolous spending.  You appreciate a settled home environment that permits you to show your love for friends and family through what you do for them rather than having to express your feelings in words.  Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail."
"  You desire to work on your own or to occupy positions of authority where you have opportunities to organize an area of interest and where your decisions are heeded.  You want to be successful financially and have an interest in investments and stocks.  Being consistent and stable in your nature, you are decisive, capable, and efficient, though not always tactful in expressing your opinions.  Your appreciation of art and music is focused around how to make these activities into viable financial opportunities.  At times, you create misunderstandings with others as it is not easy for you to be diplomatic."
" You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" Your desire to help sometimes is not appreciated, however, because they feel you are interfering.  You are fond of home and children and desire a settled environment.  You have an appreciation for music and art, and could express along these lines."
" You have an ability to concentrate and work intently on anything which holds your interest.  However, you prefer to avoid routine, monotony, and menial tasks.  You enjoy the out-of-doors and find your greatest peace and relaxation from the beauty and harmony of nature.  You prefer to limit your friendships and associations to those who share your interests and appreciate your quiet, refined ways.  Others often find it difficult to understand you.  Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" You long for freedom from restrictions and for outlets for your restless qualities, and cannot tolerate drudgery and monotony.  It is not easy for you to take advice, subsequently; you tend to work alone or independently.  You suffer inner turmoil and moods at times especially when you feel misunderstood, and being extremely sensitive, you are easily hurt and offended.  Your quiet intensity is difficult for others to understand and thus, you are on guard for fear of being ridiculed or criticized.  Loving the outdoors, you enjoy outside activities and the beauty of nature in its many facets.  Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets."
" You find it difficult to take a definite stand, partly because you lack confidence, and also because you dislike any issues which create dissension between people.  Procrastination is a weakness of your nature, causing an inability always to complete your plans or to concentrate for long.  You need to see a concept presented completely in detail before you can understand it, and if you cannot understand it, you come to your own conclusion and often fail to listen to and reason out another's point of view.  You resist being forced into change and could become almost impervious to new ideas.  You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood."
 You have a heart of gold and are always ready to give generously.
"This name encourages the expression of leadership and organizational skills, shrewdness, and analytical ability.  You are mathematically adept and have great patience with work of a detailed nature such as bookkeeping, accounting, or technical research.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair, and you budget your personal finances very carefully. Because of its matter-of-fact influence, this name limits, to some degree, your ability to be flexible and spontaneous.  You tend to treat new and unfamiliar ideas with scepticism.  Because of the serious, responsible qualities of your name, you must recognize the importance of a sense of humour and optimistic perspective of life.  In some ways you are not overly emotional and sympathetic to others and can be shrewd and materialistic.  Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
" This makes you warm-hearted and understanding in your response to the needs and interests of those around you.  You are always ready to help those in less fortunate circumstances.  Your insistence on becoming involved in the affairs of others can cause them to regard you as interfering, even though you are only trying to help.  A weakness lies in the fact that you are deeply affected through your feeling for others and could suffer through worry and disturbed thoughts over matters that you can do nothing about.  While you have an appreciation for the finer things of life and could be successful along inspirational as well as business or professional lines of endeavour, there is a tendency to become involved in the needs and interests of others to the detriment of your own progress.  Home and family are important to you and you desire to establish a settled home environment where you can enjoy the congenial companionship of friends and family."
" You have a versatile, restless nature, and could do any job well, although you would not like to do menial tasks.  You are seldom satisfied and are always seeking something new.  However, you do not know the meaning of relaxation, for when supposedly resting, your mind is forever active, planning out some new project or seeking new ways to improve your present enterprise.  You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself."
" You enjoy the simple pleasures of life especially activities that take you outdoors.  You have a few good friends who enjoy similar activities.  Living much within your own thoughts and finding it challenging to communicate easily with others, you are, at times, too candid and honest in your assessment of situations.  You feel this separation from others and would give anything to be always lighthearted and friendly instead of serious and shy."
" You strive to be different and have the self-confidence to implement your ideas because you have the perseverance necessary to see something through, despite obstacles.  Although you meet new people easily, it is not easy for you to maintain a relaxed, harmonious relationship.  With increased familiarity you are inclined to speak your mind in a forthright, sometimes argumentative manner which creates annoyance and often hard feelings.  In an argument, you usually emerge victor, but at a cost.  This name does not offer the softness of expression for long-lasting compatibility in close associations."
" You require time alone, especially in the outdoors, to cope with the pressures of life."
" While such spontaneity is fine at times, you must take account of conditions and employ careful analysis so as to avoid disastrous results such as accidents due to hasty actions.  Most things you do, you do well, but as soon as the task, hobby, or job becomes familiar or routine, you are bored and crave a change.  Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" You would be effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.  While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues."
" You always strive to create a good impression.  You are pleasant and diplomatic, and seem to sense how others feel.  You could do well in public relations work.  You have a good business sense, but tend to procrastinate and get involved with people who could interfere with your carrying your endeavours to a proper close.  Although you have many good plans, can visualize their workings, and have the best of intentions, planning is often as far as you get.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  Your emotional nature at times does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, and you experience entanglements that could prove awkward and embarrassing."
" Your quick temper can flare up suddenly and be over as suddenly, leaving you very sorry for any suffering you have caused."
"Any health weaknesses would show in skin conditions, and also fluid problems affecting the glandular system and kidneys."
" You could be very skilful in dealing with technical and mechanical matters.  You appreciate details, precision, and system and order.  These qualities, however, can make you too fussy, from time to time, over inconsequential matters.  You do not take to changes easily and can be quietly stubborn.  You do rely on the support and encouragement of others as there is an underlying lack of confidence with this name. For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions."
Physical weaknesses would show in the digestive tract and stomach.
"Tension would affect the stomach, intestinal tract or female organs."
" It is difficult for you to demonstrate tenderness and warmth and, consequently, personal relationships are not as harmonious as you wish them to be."
" You are stable, trustworthy, homeloving, and logical in practical matters, but rather unresponsive to suggestions from others.  You resist change.  This name does not give you great ambitions, vision, or imagination.  It frustrates the expression of your softer, feminine qualities in that you find it difficult to express the depth of your feelings for those you love.  It limits you to practical matters of the day, filling your life with detailed routine. hard work, and monotony."
"Weaknesses in your health caused by the influence of this name centre in the head.  Head colds, sinus conditions, hay-fever, and weak eyes are relative conditions.  Also, your tendency to worry can lead to insomnia and other overwrought conditions.
"
" You prefer situations that allow a degree of independence, but are reluctant to take on a demanding work-load or responsibility.  In a position dealing with the public, you could do well because of your friendly personality, interest in people, and desire to please.  When asked, you are able to give others good advice that you would probably not follow yourself, but must guard against being too opinionated in controversial matters."
" It also brings out your love of home and family, and in close association you are able to show understanding and affection.  Others are attracted by your generosity and your consideration of their interests.  Although this name is well balanced, if it is combined with a surname that is not harmonious, you would tend to worry and find it difficult to organize your efforts."
" When you are inspired and feel happy, life seems so wonderful; but you can be just as depressed and unhappy as well, feeling as if everyone is against you."
" It makes spontaneous, natural expression difficult.  Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs."
" In this respect, this name is not altogether constructive; it creates a somewhat scattering influence which makes it difficult for you to finish what you start.  This name brings disappointments and emotional involvements through being too sympathetic and easily influenced."
"You could suffer physically through head tension, with eye, teeth, or sinus problems, headaches, or mentally through worry."
" The desire to help others and the generous side of your nature attract those who take advantage of you.  You lack the necessary aggressiveness for business success.  While you lack verbal expression and spontaneity under this name, you have a natural literary ability and writing comes easily to you.  You also have a deep appreciation of nature and all the finer things in life."
" People with problems are drawn to you as they recognize you as one who has understanding and gives not only sympathy and comfort but provides also some constructive advice or assistance.  You have a generous quality to your nature, but you must guard carefully against giving more than you receive or you will find yourself doing without because you have helped someone else.  You love people, family, home, and friends and try to be a parent to the whole human race.  While you have generally stable conditions in your personal life, you may experience some problems in business affairs through a tendency to be scattering and inattentive to details."
"Your health could suffer through ailments centring in the head. Also, the generative organs could be affected.
"
" You have very expensive tastes, and your desires could well exceed your initiative in providing for them through your own efforts.  Personal appearance is important to you.  You are always well-groomed yourself, and you judge others by your own standard.  You do not like to rough it or use much physical energy.  Through your diplomatic ways you are able to call on the assistance of others to avoid such matters.  You have good business judgment but lack the confidence to carry out your own ideas unless assisted by an associate."
" That is when you can become somewhat inflexible.  You appreciate home and settled conditions and take on a lot of responsibility to ensure that your home life functions efficiently.  This name restricts the innate expression of an artistic, musical nature."
" Your highly capable and efficient nature make it difficult for some people to approach you.  Although you desire to serve your fellow man, you may at times lack tolerance for those who are less self-assured and whose approach to life is not as positive and optimistic as your own.  You are strongly independent and would be happiest when working without supervision, preferably in your own business where you have the challenge of ""standing or falling"" by your own decisions.  A good material standard of living is of utmost importance to you and you are careful to select only the best quality in all your purchases.  You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
"You need more stability to find peace of mind, relaxation and happiness in life.
"
" Your creative nature and ambition drive you to pursue success to the extent that you jeopardize your personal well-being.  There is a tendency for you to dominate others.  You are too certain of yourself, and you are not open to the views of others or responsive to their desires or needs.  Also, this name does not incorporate qualities that enable you to be diplomatic and to compromise.  In all your work and activities you are inclined to be rather unsystematic and disorderly.  These characteristics spoil stability, progress, and accumulation, even though you may put forth intense effort.  Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life."
" A lack of  concentration makes it difficult to establish stable, secure conditions in your business life.  In order to bring out the higher side of your nature, you should develop your artistic and creative talents."
"You are creative, promotional, and versatile, all qualities leading to success in the financial side of your life.  However, this name has made you rather aggressive, shrewd, and critical and has caused you to be extremely independent.  It is difficult for you to express fully the softer, more feminine qualities that should be a part of your nature.  This name creates such a strong, positive nature, that the more sensitive types of people would find it overpowering at times."
" From a very early age, your ambitions have been directed toward the accumulation of material wealth.  However, you have a generous side to your nature as well, and like to share what you have with others.  You have an empathy for the problems of others, particularly on social or economic issues, and you would gain satisfaction doing work of a humanitarian nature.  You have a clever mind and must have an interest outside the home to be happy.  Because of your interest in business and the affairs of the world, you find it easy to converse with all types of people.  There is a tendency for you to possess and control those closest to you, and, as a result, you would suffer with shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Your feelings are very strong and you have difficulty in controlling your temper.  You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods."
" If you cannot complete your plans when you wish to do so, you could suffer intense moods of depression and extreme sensitivity in the region of the solar plexus, resulting possibly in ulcers or nervous disorders.  This name could take you into bitter experiences through impulsive action."
" You desire a good standard of living and the best quality in all your material possessions.  You have a friendly nature, well-liked by others for your sense of humour and pleasant personality and you love parties and socializing in general.  You could be musically or artistically inclined and may often be the ""life"" of the party and would enjoy finding expression in the entertainment field.  You have a pleasure-loving nature, and although you have an ability to meet and mix with people on all levels, you tend to become involved in awkward emotional situations to your detriment.  Deriving pleasure from giving to others, you enjoy spending money on them, but tend to be a spendthrift, and not build up a reserve for emergencies."
Any weakness in health would show in the respiratory system or generative organs.
" You demand as much from others as you do from yourself.  It is difficult for you to merge your nature with others to create understanding, or to show love and tenderness to those close to you.  You experience much misunderstanding and unhappiness in your personal life as a result."
" You are attracted to, and could excel in, the mechanical or technical fields, such as computers.  Instead of establishing the system and order you would like, you are over-particular in some things that matter to you personally but lax and indulgent in other ways.  You place great importance on whatever you happen to be interested in, and can be quite thorough and detailed in what you are doing, but find it difficult to be consistent.  You scatter your efforts when things becomes too monotonous.  You have intense urges and feelings for which you can find no expression.  At times you are motivated more by moods and desires than by sound logic and reason, and under conditions of stress you could react inadvertently in temper or stubbornness that you would regret later."
 This lack of fulfilment of your deeper qualities tends to create repression and frustration.
" In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
" However, you prefer to avoid routine, monotony, and menial tasks.  You enjoy the out-of-doors and find your greatest peace and relaxation from the beauty and harmony of nature.  You prefer to limit your friendships and associations to those who share your interests and appreciate your quiet, refined ways.  Others often find it difficult to understand you.  Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" You enjoy the feeling of accomplishment from working diligently at a task.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair, and you budget your personal finances very carefully.  You are clever in mathematics and have great patience with work of a detailed nature, such as bookkeeping or accounting.  Systematic and practical in all you do, you enjoy the feeling of accomplishment from working diligently at a task.  You budget your personal finances very carefully.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair.  This name limits imagination, flexibility, responsiveness, and spontaneity in your nature.  It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures."
" You feel a limitation in your own expression when it is necessary to reach another through tact and understanding.  Although you are honest and fair, a directness in speech is a source of much consternation to you, and you often regret what you say.  You also have a tendency to worry.  It causes you to be too serious, and interferes with happiness and relaxation that comes with naturalness of expression."
"The indulgences prompted by this name can lead to high blood pressure and its relative ailments, as well as nervous tension affecting the whole nervous system."
"You are apt to be indulgent in eating rich, quick-energy foods, which you crave because your nervous system becomes depleted of vitality.  Ailments of the liver and a weak back could result."
" You like to specialize in whatever you undertake.  This name gives you an optimistic outlook on life.  You appreciate good quality in all things and want the best money can buy.  You have big ideals and dreams about the things you would like but you are not always willing to put forth the necessary effort, particularly if it means being subservient to others or having to work in an unimportant, menial capacity.  Position and means are important to you and, in order to create this impression of affluence, you will spend even when it is not prudent to do so.  You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.  You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
" People are drawn to you because they feel that you are patient, kind, understanding, and responsive.  You would be effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.  While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues."
" There are times when you would be advised to start in a smaller way, and gradually reach your desired level of success through perseverance, patience, and attention to details.  When things are going well, you have a generous, magnanimous nature, ready to offer support and assistance to others.  When under stress, you can become overbearing and belittling in your attitude to others, and inclined to express sarcasm and temper.  Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own world of personal relationships or material possessions, you could suffer disappointments with those close to you, unfulfilled ideals, or material losses."
" The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
" You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work. However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
" You resist change.  This name does not give you great ambitions, vision, or imagination.  It frustrates the expression of your softer, feminine qualities in that you find it difficult to express the depth of your feelings for those you love.  It limits you to practical matters of the day, filling your life with detailed routine. hard work, and monotony."
"Your health could suffer through disorders affecting the nervous system.  Tension centering in the head could affect the eyes, ears, sinuses, and teeth.
"
" Moods of depression can result during which you become caustic and belligerent in your attitude toward everyone, especially to those in closest association with you.  Routine, monotony, and the responsibility of looking after details can have a similar effect on you, as you are a person who desires change, travel, and new experiences.  In order to gain greater congeniality in your personal associations, you need to cultivate a more relaxed manner, greater generosity, understanding, and tolerance, and, above all, you need to avoid being too outspoken and self-opinionated."
Weakness in your health would come through emotional disturbances and tension affecting the nervous system.  Nervous indigestion and disorders in the fluid functions could result.
"You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand, and you can be deeply influenced through the thoughts of others without realizing just how you are being affected. Others are inclined to take advantage of your generosity and friendliness and then, when there is a lack of reciprocation, you can feel despondent and disillusioned. Moods are a problem as you can be highly inspired one minute, and the next become quite irritated and annoyed over some ill-timed remark or lack of consideration on the part of someone close to you."
" Unfortunately, it is difficult for you to retain emotional stability, for you can easily swing into moods of depression and self-pity.  Your quick temper can flare up suddenly and be over as suddenly, leaving you very sorry for any suffering you have caused."
" You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
" This name incorporates creative, artistic, and musical abilities, and there would be an element of originality in all that you do.  You like to do things on the spur of the moment without planning or prior arrangements.  Your spirits are buoyed up greatly by encouragement and appreciation.  There is a tendency to be scattering in your efforts and you prefer to avoid menial jobs of a routine and repetitive nature.  You are inclined to pursue good times and emotional indulgences to excess."
 The use of this name creates a lack of stability in your affairs as it inclines you to procrastinate.  It spoils patience and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are inclined to do whatever is expedient in order to avoid facing issues.  You could suffer bitter experiences through attracting wrong types of association and can be drawn into circumstances involving you in unwise situations.
" This name limits imagination, flexibility, responsiveness, and spontaneity in your nature.  It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures."
" Your love of challenging the concepts of others invariably leads you to create your own ideas and to pioneer new lines of thought.  Your strong characteristic of individuality qualifies you as a leader.  You must be independent and you do not brook interference in any way.  Although you do not tolerate interference in your own affairs, this characteristic does not prevent you from interfering in the affairs of others.  You are usually either telling or showing someone how to do something properly.  Although you are good-natured and never intend offence, still your blunt, direct, and candid manner of expression strains friendships; your honesty and sincerity earn respect from others.  You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others."
 You seldom experience the peace of mind that comes with composed thinking and emotional control.
Any weakness in your health would result from your sensitive and high-strung nature in stomach disorders such as nervous indigestion or ulcers.
"Any weakness in your health would appear in the fluid functions as kidney, bladder, or circulatory problems. or in a sensitivity affecting your stomach."
"Nervous tension centres in the solar plexus, with nervous indigestion and stomach ulcers a possible result."
" Your thinking revolves around business and ways of making money, rather than on music, art, drama, or philosophy.  You start new endeavours and incorporate new ideas, but seldom if ever receive the full benefits and financial accumulation for your efforts.  You tend to feel very frustrated in being unable to realize your ambitions fully.  An extremely independent and self-sufficient person, you dislike taking orders or advice from anyone.  You believe in speaking directly and to the point, so you are candid and abrupt.  Many friendships are lost because of your directness.  Those in close association complain that you are not inclined to observe and return acts of kindness, compassion, or affection.  You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
 Scattering of efforts interferes with success in your undertakings.
" You love people, family, home, and friends and try to be a parent to the whole human race.  While you have generally stable conditions in your personal life, you may experience some problems in business affairs through a tendency to be scattering and inattentive to details."
"If you sacrifice too much for material ambition, there may result a lack of harmony and balance in your personal life."
" Your name gives you a desire to sing, dance, and have a good time.  This name makes you very idealistic, emotional, and temperamental, liking to do things on the spur-of-the-moment and disliking being repressed or held down to monotonous detail.  A lack of  concentration makes it difficult to establish stable, secure conditions in your business life.  In order to bring out the higher side of your nature, you should develop your artistic and creative talents."
" Your feelings are so strong that you are inclined to build your life around certain individuals and become wrapped up in personal love rather than seeking into the deeper truths of life; thus you could suffer losses in your affections and shattered ideals.  You are generous and people are drawn to you because of your friendly and sympathetic nature.  You lack system and order in your life and will often leave your own duties if someone calls upon you for assistance.  When you are inspired and feel happy, life seems so wonderful; but you can be just as depressed and unhappy as well, feeling as if everyone is against you."
 You have suffered many disappointments and misunderstandings because of your inability to express your inner thoughts.
 You are inclined to do whatever is expedient in order to avoid facing issues.  You could suffer bitter experiences through attracting wrong types of association and can be drawn into circumstances involving you in unwise situations.
 You are inclined to judge things according to their material value.
 The name does not engender emotional stability; nor have you the system and order in your thinking always to finish what you start.  Scattering of efforts interferes with success in your undertakings.
" This name creates a deliberate and methodical way of thinking and speaking; it takes you time to learn but, once you have mastered a subject, you do not forget it.  You are very systematic in all you do and do not like to see things out of order; however, there is a tendency for you to be too fussy.  There is a seriousness to your nature which could cause you to worry over your responsibilities, especially when confronted with change and uncertainty."
" After each experience, you have to guard against feelings of despondency and self-pity. You have high goals and ideals, but must incorporate more practicality, system, and concentration in order to materialize them."
" While this name makes you very honest and sincere in your personal relationships, your tendency to retaliate with caustic remarks over even slight offenses could spoil many friendships."
" You can be firm, positive, and independent in your own ideas and in reaching your own decisions, yet when it comes to taking action or following things through to completion, you often need encouragement.  You respond quickly to kind words or any appreciation shown you.  There are artistic, creative abilities in this name that you could express through music or singing, or, in a practical way, through sewing or interior decorating.  You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature.  In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
" At times it is difficult for you to see the lighter or more humourous side of a situation because of your serious attitude.  Your highly capable and efficient nature make it difficult for some people to approach you.  Although you desire to serve your fellow man, you may at times lack tolerance for those who are less self-assured and whose approach to life is not as positive and optimistic as your own.  You are strongly independent and would be happiest when working without supervision, preferably in your own business where you have the challenge of ""standing or falling"" by your own decisions.  A good material standard of living is of utmost importance to you and you are careful to select only the best quality in all your purchases.  You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
" Bitter experiences could make you cynical, critical, and argumentative.  You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation."
" You are too certain of yourself, and you are not open to the views of others or responsive to their desires or needs.  Also, this name does not incorporate qualities that enable you to be diplomatic and to compromise.  In all your work and activities you are inclined to be rather unsystematic and disorderly.  These characteristics spoil stability, progress, and accumulation, even though you may put forth intense effort.  Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life."
" This name creates such a strong, positive nature, that the more sensitive types of people would find it overpowering at times."
" There is rarely a happy medium in your feelings.  Consequently, you experience many disappointments in people, tragedy, and the loss of the very things for which you may be intensely striving.  Bitter experiences could make you cynical, critical, and argumentative.  You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation."
" Because you learn so quickly you have little patience with those whose mental processes are somewhat slower, and you could become supercilious or somewhat ""know it all"" in your attitude.  This characteristic could make you rather unpopular with your associates.  Although you are very knowledgeable and intelligent, you often find spontaneous verbal expression difficult.  You crave friendship, understanding, love, and affection but your reserved manner appears forbidding to others.  You can give expression to your personal thoughts and feelings most fluently through the written word.  You have a sensitive nature--sensitive to your environment and particularly sensitive to how your deeper and more serious interests are regarded by others.  Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
 You crave understanding and affection but your intensity of desire and your self-consciousness prevent you from finding the happiness you desire.  You have suffered many disappointments and misunderstandings because of your inability to express your inner thoughts.
" If you have to make a change, it is not easy to do so happily.  You do not readily change your ideas unless you are thoroughly convinced that you must."
" Unfortunately, uncontrolled thoughts make it difficult for you to retain emotional stability, and prevent you from finding proper peace and relaxation.  You tend to centre your interest too much on whatever means the most to you, and then you become over-possessive and suffer through disillusionment and fear of losses."
"Since your feelings are strong and you tend to be enthusiastic and boisterous, you burn up your energies quickly and indulge in quick-energy foods, sweets, and starches.  This type of diet affects the functions of the liver, causing either suffering with gall stones, jaundice, or skin troubles."
" This name creates an optimistic outlook on life and favourable conditions in your personal affairs.  You have the ability to express your thoughts and ideas, and you are friendly, likeable, and generous.  You enjoy fun, laughter and congenial association.  This name also gives you an appreciation of art, music, drama, or any of the many forms of expression in the arts.  Since you are quick and fluent in your expression, you have to guard against boastfulness or dominating a situation."
" You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions.  When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.  Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
"Your spontaneous expression stands you in good stead during arguments or debates, though you are perhaps too outspoken and inclined to sarcasm.  A very real weakness of this name is lack of system and order.  The use of this name makes it extremely difficult to carry through and finish the things you start.  It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.  You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
" You scatter your efforts when things becomes too monotonous.  You have intense urges and feelings for which you can find no expression.  At times you are motivated more by moods and desires than by sound logic and reason, and under conditions of stress you could react inadvertently in temper or stubbornness that you would regret later."
" You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed and self-pitying over any real or imagined slight.  If you are not careful, people take advantage of your generous nature.  You find the beauties of nature, fine music, art, and literature--all the deeper things of life--inspiring.  The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding."
" You have a serious desire to understand the heart and mind of everyone, and could be very effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.  This name also gives you a love of home and family, and as a parent you would likely be fair and understanding.  You remember the thoughtful little expressions of affection and appreciation that mean so much to others, and you have the ability to create a warm and loving environment.  However, you tend to put things off and avoid facing issues because of a lack of confidence and uncertainty.  You often need encouragement from someone before you can come to a decision."
This name creates a weakness in the female organs of the body.  You could also suffer with nervous disorders or goitre.
" Many friendships are lost because of your directness.  Those in close association complain that you are not inclined to observe and return acts of kindness, compassion, or affection.  You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
" You are gifted with natural expression, both verbal and musical, but you would find it tedious to study music and practice theory.  Anything that involves concentration or just plain hard work, you prefer to avoid as best you can.  Although you have many creative, original ideas, procrastination is your worst enemy because you can seldom make decisions and carry them out.  In your desire to gain the favour of others and to keep peace, because you abhor friction, you change your opinion to agree with those at hand.  It is easy for you to express love and affection, but you would have to watch that your emotional nature does not get the better of you and lead you to indiscretions which you would later regret."
"Moods are a problem as you can be highly inspired one minute, and the next become quite irritated and annoyed over some ill-timed remark or lack of consideration on the part of someone close to you."
" Yours is a versatile, musical, artistic, but independent nature and you must have the freedom to express your creative ideas and abilities to be happy.  An urge for independence causes dissatisfaction and frustration in close relationships and you find the ""ties that bind"" restricting.  The qualities of this name would find a more constructive outlet in work that involves high-pressure selling or promotional activities, possibly in community affairs, for it contains a positive, driving power.  It is difficult for you to merge with others; although you have quickness of mind, you lack tolerance and can give way to impatience at another's slowness or shortcomings.  If you cannot complete your plans when you wish to do so, you could suffer intense moods of depression and extreme sensitivity in the region of the solar plexus, resulting possibly in ulcers or nervous disorders.  This name could take you into bitter experiences through impulsive action."
" Whenever possible, you avoid argument and turmoil because you prefer not to face an issue if it means hurting anyone's feelings.  You shrink from sordidness and poverty because you feel very deeply for anyone in unfortunate circumstances.  Though you recognize your responsibilities, you are inclined to put things off until you are forced to take action.  If given the opportunity, you could develop musical and artistic abilities."
" There is hardly anything you cannot do if you put your mind to it, but a driving urge leads you to one experience after another, seldom finishing what you start.  You cannot find peace of mind or lasting contentment in anything you do.  As soon as a challenge is met, boredom sets in, and you yearn for another experience.  This restlessness makes it difficult for you to assume responsibility and to establish stable, progressive conditions in your life.  You could do well in sales work or in meeting the public where quickness of mind and expression are all important.  You have many friends, but lose interest in people very quickly.  Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.  Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences."
" You want to assume responsibilities and to look after people; however, you can become too involved in other people's problems and tend to worry.  Your name gives you a natural desire to express along artistic and musical lines.  You desire a settled home and family life, and are expressive and attentive to your loved ones.  You must be careful not to become possessive and jealous of those close to you, however, as you could attract losses and unfortunate experiences.  If you attach an ideal of service to your life, you could find great happiness and could express a very beautiful, happy, responsible, artistic, and generous nature."
" You rarely experience the tranquility that comes with stability of thinking or emotional control.  At times, you are very inspired, desiring to be with people and to entertain others as the ""life of the party,"" while at other times you are aloof and choose to remove yourself entirely from association.  You crave understanding and affection but your intensity of desire and your self-consciousness prevent you from finding the happiness you desire.  You have suffered many disappointments and misunderstandings because of your inability to express your inner thoughts."
" You are adaptable and creative in responding to new situations.  This name has given you an interest in people and a desire for new experiences.  You have the ability to create a favourable first impression, and so you could do well in the fields of sales promotion or entertainment.  The use of this name creates a lack of stability in your affairs as it inclines you to procrastinate.  It spoils patience and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are inclined to do whatever is expedient in order to avoid facing issues.  You could suffer bitter experiences through attracting wrong types of association and can be drawn into circumstances involving you in unwise situations."
" While you have generally stable conditions in your personal life, you may experience some problems in business affairs through a tendency to be scattering and inattentive to details."
" In your close associations and family life, there is little demonstration of sentiment, appreciation, sympathy, or encouragement.  It is difficult for you to find the right words for such circumstances."
 This name limits imagination and vision.
" Crudeness and vulgarity are very repulsive to you and you are very particular about little things.  You suffer greatly with lack of confidence and self-consciousness.  You crave affection and understanding, yet because you can be so easily and deeply hurt, you have learned to keep your true nature hidden; therefore people do not really know you.  You always wonder if you are doing the right thing, desiring to express yourself but afraid to.  People may consider you haughty and aloof because of your sensitivity and reserved ways.  You may find some expression abut it would usually be light conversation, rarely daring to reveal your deeper thoughts or take others into your confidence for fear of criticism or ridicule.  You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
 It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive.
" In your work, you would seek a position offering self-expression through contact with people, such as sales or teaching, or a position giving scope to your creative, artistic talents.  You are good-natured and likeable, and people tend to confide in you and seek your advice in personal problems.  Others sense your sincere interest and desire to help, and you can always be counted on to see the bright side of any problem.  You enjoy making others happy and you never let your own problems ""get you down"" for any length of time, even though you do tend to worry too much at times.  Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.  In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" While your name gives you a clever, deep mind, you feel and sense much that you do not fully understand. As it is not easy for you to share your deeper thoughts and ideals with others, you are inclined to choose the association of those few friends with whom you feel the most at ease and with whom you can enjoy companionship in a contemplative mood without feeling pressure for verbal communication."
" Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work. However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
 You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed.
" You find it difficult to be systematic in business and you dislike budgeting.  Without the encouragement of others, you lack the energy, confidence, or initiative required to bring an idea to fruition."
" You are interested in understanding life along scientific, religious, and philosophical lines.  Also, you derive much enjoyment from reading and from being out in nature.  At times, you find it easier to express your thoughts in writing, rather than verbally.  You are astute regarding the value of money, have good business judgment, and can drive a hard bargain if such is required. This name has not allowed you to express fully the softer, more spontaneous qualities of your nature because of its practical business attributes.  You are matter-of-fact in your attitude to things, not easily swayed by others, nor overly compassionate to the suffering of others.  You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
" You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses and bitter experiences.  This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association."
" You enjoy fun, laughter and congenial association.  This name also gives you an appreciation of art, music, drama, or any of the many forms of expression in the arts.  Since you are quick and fluent in your expression, you have to guard against boastfulness or dominating a situation."
" You are very systematic in all you do and do not like to see things out of order; however, there is a tendency for you to be too fussy.  There is a seriousness to your nature which could cause you to worry over your responsibilities, especially when confronted with change and uncertainty."
" This name causes you to be somewhat too concerned with the personalities, problems, and activities of other people.  You seem positive and decisive and can be outspoken in the expression of your opinions, but you lack the self-confidence needed to follow through with your ideas and plans.  Procrastination is your downfall.  You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition."
 You do not accept new ideas readily and do not appreciate unsolicited advice.  You tend to be impulsive and could attract accidents as a result.
" Your strong characteristic of individuality qualifies you as a leader.  You must be independent and you do not brook interference in any way.  Although you do not tolerate interference in your own affairs, this characteristic does not prevent you from interfering in the affairs of others.  You are usually either telling or showing someone how to do something properly.  Although you are good-natured and never intend offence, still your blunt, direct, and candid manner of expression strains friendships; your honesty and sincerity earn respect from others.  You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others."
" Finding it difficult to join in conversation with those with whom you are not well-acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative with new acquaintances or in a large crowd.  As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly.  You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
"There is a weakness in the fluid functions and in the region  of the head resulting in sinus problems, headaches, eye, ear, or throat conditions and related ailments.  Hair loss could also be a problem."
" Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.  In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" Your mind is quick to comprehend and you can be depended upon to do any job well.  Because you tend to be somewhat of a perfectionist, you might insist on doing too many things yourself instead of delegating jobs to others who might do less satisfactory work.  This name does make you quite direct and straight-to-the-point.  Your verbal expression does not reflect your inner thoughts and feelings, and you often wonder why people react to what you say.  The influence of this name does not promote the friendship that you desire or the relaxation and naturalness you should enjoy with people.  It is a name that makes you far too practical and serious-minded, and makes it difficult for you to act with spontaneity."
"It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive.  Tension, which is destructive to your health, affects you in the area of the solar plexus and stomach.  You could also suffer with problems in the female generative organs."
" Your calmness of mind enables you to analyze objectively, and to make decisions quickly, making it possible for you to do well in business or in any professional capacity.  Because of your serious, self-possessed nature you can appear domineering and forceful to others.  You have a strong humanitarian nature and many times you are called upon to assist others with their problems.  Your desire to help sometimes is not appreciated, however, because they feel you are interfering.  You are fond of home and children and desire a settled environment.  You have an appreciation for music and art, and could express along these lines."
" However, there is a tendency to be a little too independent in your thinking and it is difficult for you to accept the help of others when you should."
"Because of your sensitive nervous system, over-stress and extreme tiredness could cause nervous disorders, seizures, fainting, or dizziness.  You could also experience head tension such as headaches, weak eyes, or throat problems."
"You are overly fond of heavy foods such as meat, potatoes, breads and pastries and could suffer with stomach and intestinal disorders."
"This name can adversely affect the health of your respiratory organs, the heart and lungs.  Also, you are prone to suffer from weaknesses centering in the head."
" You are mathematically adept and have great patience with work of a detailed nature such as bookkeeping, accounting, or technical research.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair, and you budget your personal finances very carefully. Because of its matter-of-fact influence, this name limits, to some degree, your ability to be flexible and spontaneous.  You tend to treat new and unfamiliar ideas with scepticism.  Because of the serious, responsible qualities of your name, you must recognize the importance of a sense of humour and optimistic perspective of life.  In some ways you are not overly emotional and sympathetic to others and can be shrewd and materialistic.  Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
"You could be expressive and creative in the arts, music, or drama. Since you are not inclined to give due consideration to practical and business matters, you could miss out on reaching a level of financial success appropriate for your efforts and abilities. You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand, and you can be deeply influenced through the thoughts of others without realizing just how you are being affected. Others are inclined to take advantage of your generosity and friendliness and then, when there is a lack of reciprocation, you can feel despondent and disillusioned. Moods are a problem as you can be highly inspired one minute, and the next become quite irritated and annoyed over some ill-timed remark or lack of consideration on the part of someone close to you."
" You have a generous quality to your nature, but you must guard carefully against giving more than you receive or you will find yourself doing without because you have helped someone else.  You love people, family, home, and friends and try to be a parent to the whole human race.  While you have generally stable conditions in your personal life, you may experience some problems in business affairs through a tendency to be scattering and inattentive to details."
" You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
" You are a patient person and you will work hard one step at a time to accomplish your endeavours.  You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but are not inclined to pursue inspirational or creative expression as in music or the arts.  As you have modest ambitions, you are content to live from day to day and to save for your future.  You budget carefully and do not believe in frivolous spending.  You appreciate a settled home environment that permits you to show your love for friends and family through what you do for them rather than having to express your feelings in words.  Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail."
" There is a tendency for you to possess and control those closest to you, and, as a result, you would suffer with shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Your feelings are very strong and you have difficulty in controlling your temper.  You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods."
"This name has not allowed you to express fully the softer, more spontaneous qualities of your nature because of its practical business attributes.  You are matter-of-fact in your attitude to things, not easily swayed by others, nor overly compassionate to the suffering of others.  You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
" Although you have a good appreciation of material values, business ability, and skill in organizing and managing others, your success is restricted by a lack of self-confidence and initiative.  You have very expensive tastes, and your desires could well exceed your initiative in providing for them through your own efforts.  Personal appearance is important to you.  You are always well-groomed yourself, and you judge others by your own standard.  You do not like to rough it or use much physical energy.  Through your diplomatic ways you are able to call on the assistance of others to avoid such matters.  You have good business judgment but lack the confidence to carry out your own ideas unless assisted by an associate."
" Your desire for peace at any price can result in going out of your way to avoid arguments and confrontation or hurting the feelings of others.  Also, budgeting can be a problem as you enjoy spending money and can easily ignore being practical."
Weaknesses in health show in the senses of the head as well as in the various fluid functions of the body.
" You tend to avoid issues, however, and put off until tomorrow decisions that should be made today.  For that reason, you would find difficulty in achieving success in positions requiring aggressiveness and quick decisions.  Your inclination is to pursue a line of work where you carry some level of responsibility and diplomacy is required in contact with people.  Others can, at times, take advantage of your gentle nature."
" Being somewhat wilful and skeptical, you learn best through your own experiences and seek proof though facts.  You work best alone, making your own decisions, and learning from your own experiences.  Despite your loyalty to friends, your communication at times is stilted, too candid, and frank."
"As a result of your active nature, you have an appetite for quick-energy foods, which you could consume to excess.  Health weakness appear as skin conditions, or as ailments relative to the liver.
"
" This name restricts proper verbal expression; as a result, you are often lonely, craving understanding of others.  Yours is a very deep, reflective nature, but others would never know it as you keep your deeper feelings within."
" You have imagination and many ideas but you lack the drive or initiative to put these into effect.  It is difficult for you to say ""no"" and mean it or to carry through with any commitments you have made.  This name makes you too lackadaisical.  The influence of this name is to lack practicality, system and order, organizing ability, astuteness, and the ability to make decisions and act upon them.  Due to procrastination you have many unfulfilled desires.  You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
" You appreciate good quality in all things and want the best money can buy.  You have big ideals and dreams about the things you would like but you are not always willing to put forth the necessary effort, particularly if it means being subservient to others or having to work in an unimportant, menial capacity.  Position and means are important to you and, in order to create this impression of affluence, you will spend even when it is not prudent to do so.  You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.  You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
Your reticence has caused you to suffer aloneness and misunderstandings.  You would like to be easy-going and spontaneous but it does not come easily.  You can express yourself better through writing than verbally.  The mysteries of life appeal to you in your search for an understanding of the greater picture of life.  You love to read and can develop great powers of concentration.
" If you are not careful, people take advantage of your generous nature.  You find the beauties of nature, fine music, art, and literature--all the deeper things of life--inspiring.  The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding."
"  You desire to work on your own or at least where you are making your own decisions.  You enjoy working with your hands and can be resourceful and inventive along practical lines.  Being much focused on your pursuits, at times you overlook the personal considerations and attentions that create understanding and companionship with others.  This name causes you to suffer with self-consciousness in new situations and an inability to be diplomatic when situations warrant.  You are loyal in friendships and express candidly.   You enjoy outdoors activities with a few close friends."
" You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof.  The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
 You have a traditional and conservative outlook in almost everything.
" The influence of this name is to lack practicality, system and order, organizing ability, astuteness, and the ability to make decisions and act upon them.  Due to procrastination you have many unfulfilled desires.  You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
" Although you are naturally happy and generous, you fail to hold friendships because you are inclined to be too dogmatic, argumentative, or sarcastic.  In an argument, you usually emerge the victor, but at a cost."
" It is far easier for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings through writing than verbally.  You find pleasure in literature, in poetry, and in your ideals and will turn to them when you feel you have been misunderstood.  You are deeply moved by the beauties of life, especially nature.  Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next.  Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money.  This name creates a nature that can be the life of the party, but many times you can become involved in emotional situations against your better judgment.  Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to."
" Because of your interest in business and the affairs of the world, you find it easy to converse with all types of people.  There is a tendency for you to possess and control those closest to you, and, as a result, you would suffer with shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Your feelings are very strong and you have difficulty in controlling your temper.  You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods."
"Due to your strong sense of responsibility, you could experience worry and mental turmoil through assuming more responsibility than you should.  Friction could arise through others feeling that you were interfering with their rights and privileges, even though you are only trying to help."
" You have many ideas, plans, and ambitions, but too often they are for an easy way out of a difficulty or an easy way of making money.  You seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.   You find it difficult to systematize your efforts and to fulfil your obligations and plans as you are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job to reach your goals.  Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power.  This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people.  The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
" You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
 It is difficult for you to find the right words for such circumstances.
"  You find it difficult to systematize your efforts and to fulfil your obligations and plans as you are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job to reach your goals.  Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power.  This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people.  The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
"You desire a home and family of your own and have the ability to create understanding and harmony in family association as you are pliable, forgiving, and tactful.  You love children and would not hesitate to care for any children who might need you.  Whenever possible, you avoid argument and turmoil because you prefer not to face an issue if it means hurting anyone's feelings.  You shrink from sordidness and poverty because you feel very deeply for anyone in unfortunate circumstances.  Though you recognize your responsibilities, you are inclined to put things off until you are forced to take action.  If given the opportunity, you could develop musical and artistic abilities."
" Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
" Imaginative, theoretical, or inspirational ideas are of little interest to you.  In close association you are not often attentive to the needs of others.  It is difficult for you to demonstrate tenderness and warmth and, consequently, personal relationships are not as harmonious as you wish them to be."
"This name creates a generally well-balanced and healthy nature, but any weakness in the health would cause problems in the fluid functions, such as kidney or bladder trouble, overweight, or swelling of the legs and ankles."
"Health problems centre in the head affecting the eyes, ears, sinuses, or teeth.  Also, tension could afflict the female generative organs."
"Your health would be affected through the fluid functions, liver trouble, or a weak back. "
" An appreciation for quality has prompted you to strive for the best standard in dress, material possessions, and choice of food.  On occasion, you can be intolerant and critical of others, quick to argue and to dominate situations.  Though the name offers a fair degree of balance, you would have to watch that strong appetites do not find an outlet through excessive eating, causing overweight and resultant problems, or through emotional experiences which could create unsettled conditions in your personal life."
 Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to.
" Deriving pleasure from giving to others, you enjoy spending money on them, but tend to be a spendthrift, and not build up a reserve for emergencies."
"Health weaknesses centre in the head appearing as headaches, head colds, and eye, teeth, ear, or sinus problems.
"
" As a child you were expressive.  An imaginative, impressionable person, you could excel in the theatre as a dramatist or comedienne, and the enjoyment and appreciation of your audience would be your greatest inspiration.  Fine as your nature is at times the power of your feelings is difficult to control as it unleashes itself through outbursts of temper.  The name does not engender emotional stability; nor have you the system and order in your thinking always to finish what you start.  Scattering of efforts interferes with success in your undertakings."
"More congenial business and personal relationships would result from being more tactful and more aware of the needs of others. If you sacrifice too much for material ambition, there may result a lack of harmony and balance in your personal life."
" It is difficult for you to merge with others; although you have quickness of mind, you lack tolerance and can give way to impatience at another's slowness or shortcomings.  If you cannot complete your plans when you wish to do so, you could suffer intense moods of depression and extreme sensitivity in the region of the solar plexus, resulting possibly in ulcers or nervous disorders.  This name could take you into bitter experiences through impulsive action."
" However, you have to watch that others do not take advantage of your generosity, for you are apt to be influenced by hard-luck stories and give when it might be more prudent not to.  You are ever on the watch for ways and means of making some ""easy money"" because this name destroys initiative and ambition, producing an easy-going, come-what-may nature which attaches value to money only for the self-enjoyment it can offer.  Misunderstandings could exist in your personal life because of this emotional power which you have difficulty controlling and also because of a difficulty in accepting a responsibility and seeing it through.  You are apt to leave a project unfinished and go on to something else.  Routine and system are foreign to your life, and, of course, these assets are an integral part of any successful undertaking."
" You have a friendly nature, well-liked by others for your sense of humour and pleasant personality and you love parties and socializing in general.  You could be musically or artistically inclined and may often be the ""life"" of the party and would enjoy finding expression in the entertainment field.  You have a pleasure-loving nature, and although you have an ability to meet and mix with people on all levels, you tend to become involved in awkward emotional situations to your detriment.  Deriving pleasure from giving to others, you enjoy spending money on them, but tend to be a spendthrift, and not build up a reserve for emergencies."
" In situations where you are serving others, demonstrating or instructing, you have the patience to go into details that someone else may not think to be important.  In your association with others, you are often limited to the more mundane happenings and little personal problems that can be so frustrating to those of an active, dynamic nature.  You desire to create system and order in your environment but are inclined to become side-tracked and socialize when you should be working.  Your ambitions are not large, as you lack confidence in your own abilities and would sooner not take a chance.  You are often at odds with yourself, knowing what you should do, but finding it hard to find the initiative and will power to do it.  Liking to plan and think ahead, you do not act impulsively and do not like to have your plans or routine interfered with. You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
" You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" You are not overly ambitious, preferring instead just to seek stable, settled conditions which are adequate to meet your responsibilities.  In your personal relations with others, you are inclined to be rather serious, and not to see the humour others see, or to respond spontaneously.  Your positive manner and outlook can make others feel that you are imposing your will on them and even interfering in their affairs."
" You have good business judgment and would do well in a managerial position, as you have executive ability.  You work best in an independent capacity, where you are able to think problems out carefully before you act.  Your sensitivity and reserve prevent people from coming close in friendship.  There is always an aloofness and reserve that acts as a barrier and prevents any close ties. You live much within your own thoughts, and seek relaxation away from people, out in nature, where you can ease the tensions of your life.  You find it difficult to express your true feelings, whether it be affection, appreciation, or tenderness, which play such an important part in creating a close bond within the family."
" If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
"This name creates strong physical desires, such as an appetite for heavy, starchy foods and meat.  Tension affecting the solar plexus and digestive organs could lead to stomach and intestinal problems."
" A natural rhythm, a sense of colour harmony, and creative ability contribute to a flair for composition and artistic and musical expression.  Expression comes easily to you; in fact, you should learn to control it and discipline your expression. You are not practical where money matters are concerned, your theory being that money is there to be spent.  You are kind and generous, and will fill a need when you see it; at times, others take advantage of your generosity. The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
" You desire to create system and order in your environment but are inclined to become side-tracked and socialize when you should be working.  Your ambitions are not large, as you lack confidence in your own abilities and would sooner not take a chance.  You are often at odds with yourself, knowing what you should do, but finding it hard to find the initiative and will power to do it.  Liking to plan and think ahead, you do not act impulsively and do not like to have your plans or routine interfered with. You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
" You are too generous and if appealed to will give all you have because you find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  You do not like to create tension or friction and will try various means to avoid such situations.  You are very idealistic.  You have imagination and many ideas but lack the ambition and drive necessary to accomplish your undertakings.  Many times you dream about the things you desire in life, but when it comes down to putting forth the necessary effort and accomplishing your goals, you do not have the strength and initiative.  This name does not allow you the system and order your life requires to run in a smooth, efficient way, and if possible you will avoid having to make decisions because you feel much more secure when you can lean on others.  Many times you make promises you do not keep, although your intentions are always good."
" You are fussy about details and seek perfection in whatever you undertake.  Being somewhat wilful and skeptical, you learn best through your own experiences and seek proof though facts.  You work best alone, making your own decisions, and learning from your own experiences.  Despite your loyalty to friends, your communication at times is stilted, too candid, and frank."
" On the other hand, you can be impulsive and forceful when opposed, and act without due forethought and discretion.  Hence you have many bitter experiences and generally rather unsettled conditions in your life, with little progress and financial accumulation.  You cannot tolerate any domination by others, or circumstances that restrict your freedom and independence.  You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions.  When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.  Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
" At times, you are very inspired, desiring to be with people and to entertain others as the ""life of the party,"" while at other times you are aloof and choose to remove yourself entirely from association.  You crave understanding and affection but your intensity of desire and your self-consciousness prevent you from finding the happiness you desire.  You have suffered many disappointments and misunderstandings because of your inability to express your inner thoughts."
" This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" You have a humanitarian and principled side to your character and will go out of your way to help someone if you feel there is injustice or unfairness.  You often become involved in situations without any thought of the consequences.  You are basically seeking truth in life and have a very analytical and questioning mind.  Being perceptive and intuitive, you often respond to your hunches, which can lead you into bitter experiences.  You love change, travel, and new opportunities and dislike monotonous detail.  Though you show enthusiasm over a new-found interest, you seldom finish the things you start.  If you are repressed or restricted in any way, you become frustrated, moody, and depressed.  You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
The physical weakness created by this name affects the fluid functions of the body.
 You appreciate a settled home environment that permits you to show your love for friends and family through what you do for them rather than having to express your feelings in words.  Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail.
" All the finer things of life and beauties of nature are an inspiration to you and you are attracted to the mysteries of nature.  Difficulty in expression results in your being too positive, blunt, and candid in speech and although you are easily offended by others, you do not show it.  You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof.  The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
" You are matter-of-fact in your attitude to things, not easily swayed by others, nor overly compassionate to the suffering of others.  You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
" In your association with others, you are often limited to the more mundane happenings and little personal problems that can be so frustrating to those of an active, dynamic nature.  You desire to create system and order in your environment but are inclined to become side-tracked and socialize when you should be working.  Your ambitions are not large, as you lack confidence in your own abilities and would sooner not take a chance.  You are often at odds with yourself, knowing what you should do, but finding it hard to find the initiative and will power to do it.  Liking to plan and think ahead, you do not act impulsively and do not like to have your plans or routine interfered with. You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
"This name creates strong physical desires, such as an appetite for heavy, starchy foods and meat.  Tension affecting the solar plexus and digestive organs stomach or intestinal disorders."
" Being methodical, you work best where you have the time to do a good job, although you can be too fussy at times finding it difficult to react spontaneously to new ideas from others.  You rebel at being rushed or put under pressure.  That is when you can become somewhat inflexible.  You appreciate home and settled conditions and take on a lot of responsibility to ensure that your home life functions efficiently.  This name restricts the innate expression of an artistic, musical nature."
" You are often at odds with yourself, knowing what you should do, but finding it hard to find the initiative and will power to do it.  Liking to plan and think ahead, you do not act impulsively and do not like to have your plans or routine interfered with. You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
" You are too fond of sugars and starches, thus you could have a weakness in your liver, kidneys, or skin, creating pimples or eczema.  While this name gives you a wonderful personality, and attracts much love and friendship, it is far too emotional and scattering an influence and will not allow the material accumulation nor personal happiness you should have.
"
" Your circle of friends is restricted to those of like nature.  Once friendship is established, you are very loyal and steadfast and do not tolerate gossip or criticism.  In your close associations and family life, there is little demonstration of sentiment, appreciation, sympathy, or encouragement.  It is difficult for you to find the right words for such circumstances."
" You do, however, have leadership ability and would never be happy in a subservient position.  You are ambitious and aggressive by nature.  You would be happiest in positions where you are free to express individually and creatively and where opportunities are not restricted; you desire freedom, and do not tolerate being possessed by others.  You appreciate change and travel, and the opportunity to meet and mix with others, and to influence them with your creative ideas.  You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses and bitter experiences.  This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association."
Health weakness would appear as skin conditions or ailments relative to the liver.  A tendency to overeat quick-energy foods aggravates any health problems.
 Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures.
"Inner turbulence can deplete your vitality and cause heart, lung, or bronchial trouble, as well as nervous disabilities."
" Living much within your own thoughts and finding it challenging to communicate easily with others, you are, at times, too candid and honest in your assessment of situations.  You feel this separation from others and would give anything to be always lighthearted and friendly instead of serious and shy."
" The greatest lack in your life is stability and peace of mind.  A peaceful and quiet environment, especially out in nature, is one of your greatest desires, but you are constantly taken into chaotic conditions.  Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness.  You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.  Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed."
" Then you become disillusioned when they fall short of your expectations.  You are quick mentally and like to see things moving at an accelerated pace.  Patience is not one of your virtues; you want to move when the impulse strikes you.  While such spontaneity is fine at times, you must take account of conditions and employ careful analysis so as to avoid disastrous results such as accidents due to hasty actions.  Most things you do, you do well, but as soon as the task, hobby, or job becomes familiar or routine, you are bored and crave a change.  Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" You do not take to changes easily and can be quietly stubborn.  You do rely on the support and encouragement of others as there is an underlying lack of confidence with this name. For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions."
"You are not practical where money matters are concerned, your theory being that money is there to be spent.  You are kind and generous, and will fill a need when you see it; at times, others take advantage of your generosity. The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
" Writing is a more natural mode of expression for your deeper thoughts and feelings than the spoken word.  You have an ability to concentrate and work intently on anything which holds your interest.  However, you prefer to avoid routine, monotony, and menial tasks.  You enjoy the out-of-doors and find your greatest peace and relaxation from the beauty and harmony of nature.  You prefer to limit your friendships and associations to those who share your interests and appreciate your quiet, refined ways.  Others often find it difficult to understand you.  Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
" Due to procrastination you have many unfulfilled desires.  You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
" You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
" Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
" You are seldom open to new ideas except those you can prove to yourself in a tangible way.  Imaginative, theoretical, or inspirational ideas are of little interest to you.  In close association you are not often attentive to the needs of others.  It is difficult for you to demonstrate tenderness and warmth and, consequently, personal relationships are not as harmonious as you wish them to be."
" Once friendship is established, you are very loyal and steadfast and do not tolerate gossip or criticism.  In your close associations and family life, there is little demonstration of sentiment, appreciation, sympathy, or encouragement.  It is difficult for you to find the right words for such circumstances."
" You have a clever mind and must have an interest outside the home to be happy.  Because of your interest in business and the affairs of the world, you find it easy to converse with all types of people.  There is a tendency for you to possess and control those closest to you, and, as a result, you would suffer with shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Your feelings are very strong and you have difficulty in controlling your temper.  You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods."
" You have a sensitive nature--sensitive to your environment and particularly sensitive to how your deeper and more serious interests are regarded by others.  Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
" Appreciating quality in all things, you desire to be prosperous.  You do not like to relinquish control nor do you accept advice readily.  You have a strong, determined nature and you must be careful that you do not dominate or interfere in the lives of others in your desire to be helpful.  This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.  You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
 You are inclined to procrastinate and let things slide and to make promises that you find difficult to fulfil although you have the best of intentions.
" Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents."
" You have large ambitions, and it is difficult for you to be tolerant and understanding of those who desire less in life or who are more slow and methodical by nature.  Patience is not your forte.  You do, however, have leadership ability and would never be happy in a subservient position.  You are ambitious and aggressive by nature.  You would be happiest in positions where you are free to express individually and creatively and where opportunities are not restricted; you desire freedom, and do not tolerate being possessed by others.  You appreciate change and travel, and the opportunity to meet and mix with others, and to influence them with your creative ideas.  You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses and bitter experiences.  This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association."
" People are inclined to take advantage of your sympathetic, tractable nature.  You naturally attract people with problems who seek your understanding and advice.  You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself.  You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence."
" When you are interested in a project, you concentrate all your thoughts on it and do not appreciate being interrupted.  This name creates a deliberate and methodical way of thinking and speaking; it takes you time to learn but, once you have mastered a subject, you do not forget it.  You are very systematic in all you do and do not like to see things out of order; however, there is a tendency for you to be too fussy.  There is a seriousness to your nature which could cause you to worry over your responsibilities, especially when confronted with change and uncertainty."
" They could interpret your quietness as disinterest and aloofness, for they do not realize the depth of your feelings and thoughts.  You require time alone, especially in the outdoors, to cope with the pressures of life."
" You want to be more expressive, diplomatic, and easy-going, but you feel the limitation in your communication with others and it creates frustration within you."
" You are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job and to reach the fulfilment of your goals through perseverance and hard work.  The influence of this name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally.  You are never satisfied with conditions, because your feelings and desires are so changeable.  Hence you seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.  There are people in your association who could influence you unfavourably and thereby mislead you; disillusionment, embarrassment, and bitter experiences then become your lot.  You have a very talkative nature and because of it, you could do well in saleswork or in a position where you handle the public.  However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
" Worry and depression could be problems in your life.  Physically, any weaknesses in your health would centre in the heart, lungs, or bronchial organs."
"Health weaknesses could appear in the digestive system, or in disorders affecting the heart, lungs, or bronchial organs."
" You appreciate the finer things of life, and like to have a good standard of living.  You feel that it is important to convey the impression that you are financially secure, and you place importance on your mode of dress, and on appearances generally.  While you could do well in certain positions of authority, you have a certain lack of initiative and a tendency to procrastinate.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work. However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
 You do not like to rough it or use much physical energy.  Through your diplomatic ways you are able to call on the assistance of others to avoid such matters.  You have good business judgment but lack the confidence to carry out your own ideas unless assisted by an associate.
"You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
" Having considerable vision, you could be adept at formulating new, more effective ways of doing things.  You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself.  You could work well in sales and promotion, and would not be afraid to risk a gamble as the name gives you much self-confidence.  You do not find contentment in the routine tasks and responsibilities that are associated with home and family or with administrative detail in the business world, so you have to guard against frustration and even moods of depression over your personal responsibilities.  The restlessness this name creates could find an outlet in caustic, irritable expression."
" You do everything with an intensity to the point of fervour, and either you feel tremendous elation or you are in the depths of despair.  People often disappoint you because you are idealistic and are apt to place those whom you admire on a pedestal.  Then you become disillusioned when they fall short of your expectations.  You are quick mentally and like to see things moving at an accelerated pace.  Patience is not one of your virtues; you want to move when the impulse strikes you.  While such spontaneity is fine at times, you must take account of conditions and employ careful analysis so as to avoid disastrous results such as accidents due to hasty actions.  Most things you do, you do well, but as soon as the task, hobby, or job becomes familiar or routine, you are bored and crave a change.  Travel and new horizons ever intrigue you, but your hunger for greener fields is insatiable, and so you do not experience contentment and peace of mind.  There is such a driving power within you that, you cannot find an outlet or if your actions are thwarted in some way, you feel the reaction through extreme tension in the region of your solar plexus.  The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" You desire your life to be orderly and systematized and you keep your surroundings neat and tidy, but others often see you as fussy over little things.  You are a patient person and you will work hard one step at a time to accomplish your endeavours.  You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but are not inclined to pursue inspirational or creative expression as in music or the arts.  As you have modest ambitions, you are content to live from day to day and to save for your future.  You budget carefully and do not believe in frivolous spending.  You appreciate a settled home environment that permits you to show your love for friends and family through what you do for them rather than having to express your feelings in words.  Friction in association could result if you are critical of those who do not live up to your regard for system and detail."
" Personal appearance is important to you.  You are always well-groomed yourself, and you judge others by your own standard.  You do not like to rough it or use much physical energy.  Through your diplomatic ways you are able to call on the assistance of others to avoid such matters.  You have good business judgment but lack the confidence to carry out your own ideas unless assisted by an associate."
" Routine, monotony, and the responsibility of looking after details can have a similar effect on you, as you are a person who desires change, travel, and new experiences.  In order to gain greater congeniality in your personal associations, you need to cultivate a more relaxed manner, greater generosity, understanding, and tolerance, and, above all, you need to avoid being too outspoken and self-opinionated."
" Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.  You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" Consequently, you experience many disappointments in people, tragedy, and the loss of the very things for which you may be intensely striving.  Bitter experiences could make you cynical, critical, and argumentative.  You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation."
" You desire the best in life and appreciate quality in all things.  This name has made you rather aggressive, shrewd, and critical and has caused you to be extremely independent.  You have the analysis, vision, and promotional ability to make progress.  You could achieve heights of success in business, but there is also a factor which brings many forced changes and friction with people, which in turn offsets the success you could achieve.  The more sensitive types of people find you overpowering at times.  You tend to have too many irons in the fire and fail to complete your undertakings satisfactorily.  Business success could be achieved, to a point, abut your personal life would suffer.  It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive."
" An imaginative, impressionable person, you could excel in the theatre as a dramatist or comedienne, and the enjoyment and appreciation of your audience would be your greatest inspiration.  Fine as your nature is at times the power of your feelings is difficult to control as it unleashes itself through outbursts of temper.  The name does not engender emotional stability; nor have you the system and order in your thinking always to finish what you start.  Scattering of efforts interferes with success in your undertakings."
 At times you are torn between your desire for system and order and your desire for change and new experiences.  You have to guard against impatience and criticism of the weaknesses of others.  Your impulsive nature could lead to accidents.
You could suffer female disturbances or other problems in the generative organs.
"This name could cause you to suffer through a sensitivity in the fluid functions, causing female disorders, swelling of the legs and ankles, or general blood debility.  There is also a weakness in the region of the heart and respiratory organs."
 It spoils patience and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are inclined to do whatever is expedient in order to avoid facing issues.  You could suffer bitter experiences through attracting wrong types of association and can be drawn into circumstances involving you in unwise situations.
" Your delight in mystery and your sensitivity to things you do not understand could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, it is difficult for you to retain emotional stability, for you can easily swing into moods of depression and self-pity.  Your quick temper can flare up suddenly and be over as suddenly, leaving you very sorry for any suffering you have caused."
" Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents."
" You rebel at being rushed or put under pressure.  That is when you can become somewhat inflexible.  You appreciate home and settled conditions and take on a lot of responsibility to ensure that your home life functions efficiently.  This name restricts the innate expression of an artistic, musical nature."
" Also, you derive much enjoyment from reading and from being out in nature.  At times, you find it easier to express your thoughts in writing, rather than verbally.  You are astute regarding the value of money, have good business judgment, and can drive a hard bargain if such is required. This name has not allowed you to express fully the softer, more spontaneous qualities of your nature because of its practical business attributes.  You are matter-of-fact in your attitude to things, not easily swayed by others, nor overly compassionate to the suffering of others.  You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
" You can enjoy reading, study, and contemplation about many different subjects.  When your interests or curiosity are aroused, you work intensely at new undertakings, but your interests often wane when you encounter drudgery and monotony, with the result that you leave many things unfinished.  Your name has taken you into many bitter experiences.  The greatest lack in your life is stability and peace of mind.  A peaceful and quiet environment, especially out in nature, is one of your greatest desires, but you are constantly taken into chaotic conditions.  Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness.  You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.  Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed."
" You will never tolerate a situation where your independence and individuality are curtailed.  Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
" You find it difficult to discipline your desires and emotional feelings.  Too idealistic and impractical through the use of this name, you would not find it easy to make a success in the business world.  You are inclined to procrastinate and let things slide and to make promises that you find difficult to fulfil although you have the best of intentions."
 This name brings disappointments and emotional involvements through being too sympathetic and easily influenced.
" Your name has taken you into many bitter experiences.  The greatest lack in your life is stability and peace of mind.  A peaceful and quiet environment, especially out in nature, is one of your greatest desires, but you are constantly taken into chaotic conditions.  Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness.  You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.  Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed."
" Your active, restless nature demands action and you dislike system and monotony.  As you are versatile and capable, you could do any job well, although you would not like to do menial tasks.  Having considerable vision, you could be adept at formulating new, more effective ways of doing things.  You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself.  You could work well in sales and promotion, and would not be afraid to risk a gamble as the name gives you much self-confidence.  You do not find contentment in the routine tasks and responsibilities that are associated with home and family or with administrative detail in the business world, so you have to guard against frustration and even moods of depression over your personal responsibilities.  The restlessness this name creates could find an outlet in caustic, irritable expression."
" You suffer greatly with lack of confidence and self-consciousness.  You crave affection and understanding, yet because you can be so easily and deeply hurt, you have learned to keep your true nature hidden; therefore people do not really know you.  You always wonder if you are doing the right thing, desiring to express yourself but afraid to.  People may consider you haughty and aloof because of your sensitivity and reserved ways.  You may find some expression abut it would usually be light conversation, rarely daring to reveal your deeper thoughts or take others into your confidence for fear of criticism or ridicule.  You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
"Any weakness in your health would cause you to suffer through either kidney trouble, female problems, or varicose veins.  Due to a sensitivity in your nervous system, you could experience nervous disorders.
"
" You tend to feel very frustrated in being unable to realize your ambitions fully.  An extremely independent and self-sufficient person, you dislike taking orders or advice from anyone.  You believe in speaking directly and to the point, so you are candid and abrupt.  Many friendships are lost because of your directness.  Those in close association complain that you are not inclined to observe and return acts of kindness, compassion, or affection.  You would be a firm parent and your children would be well-disciplined, but you would find it difficult to get close to them and to show compassion and affection."
 This name could take you into bitter experiences through impulsive action.
" You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence."
" A peaceful and quiet environment, especially out in nature, is one of your greatest desires, but you are constantly taken into chaotic conditions.  Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness.  You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.  Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.  You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.  You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other.  Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed."
" A lack of positivity and confidence is a source of difficulty in making decisions in business dealings.  You are easily offended, and can suffer with moods of depression.  You want the best, but lack the confidence and aggressiveness to materialize your desires.  Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
" You work best alone making your own decisions as it is not always easy for you to respond to the advice and direction of others as you feel the need to be in control.  You enjoy the simple pleasures of life especially activities that take you outdoors.  You have a few good friends who enjoy similar activities.  Living much within your own thoughts and finding it challenging to communicate easily with others, you are, at times, too candid and honest in your assessment of situations.  You feel this separation from others and would give anything to be always lighthearted and friendly instead of serious and shy."
"You enjoy sweet, rich foods, as well as meat and starches, and any indulgence would create skin disorders or possible intestinal trouble."
" You appreciate details, precision, and system and order.  These qualities, however, can make you too fussy, from time to time, over inconsequential matters.  You do not take to changes easily and can be quietly stubborn.  You do rely on the support and encouragement of others as there is an underlying lack of confidence with this name. For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions."
" A weakness lies in the fact that you are deeply affected through your feeling for others and could suffer through worry and disturbed thoughts over matters that you can do nothing about.  While you have an appreciation for the finer things of life and could be successful along inspirational as well as business or professional lines of endeavour, there is a tendency to become involved in the needs and interests of others to the detriment of your own progress.  Home and family are important to you and you desire to establish a settled home environment where you can enjoy the congenial companionship of friends and family."
"You could suffer with head tension, or any weakness relative to the heart, lungs, or bronchial organs."
" Although you are not naturally spontaneous in musical or artistic expression, you can develop technical proficiency along these lines.  You are fussy about details and seek perfection in whatever you undertake.  Being somewhat wilful and skeptical, you learn best through your own experiences and seek proof though facts.  You work best alone, making your own decisions, and learning from your own experiences.  Despite your loyalty to friends, your communication at times is stilted, too candid, and frank."
"You have a clever, quick mind, with the ability to accomplish a great deal in a short period of time, although it is not easy for you to systematize your efforts.  This name could allow expression along musical and artistic lines and gives you the desire to entertain and to meet and mix with people of refinement and culture.  It also brings out your love of home and family, and in close association you are able to show understanding and affection.  Others are attracted by your generosity and your consideration of their interests.  Although this name is well balanced, if it is combined with a surname that is not harmonious, you would tend to worry and find it difficult to organize your efforts."
" The more sensitive types of people find you overpowering at times.  You tend to have too many irons in the fire and fail to complete your undertakings satisfactorily.  Business success could be achieved, to a point, abut your personal life would suffer.  It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive."
" You have a clever, deep mind and the talent to excel in highly inspirational lines of endeavour as a dramatist, musician, writer, or artist.  You can be lifted by beauty in all forms and are at the most creative when inspired.  Your expressive, affectionate nature responds quickly through your feelings, but you must guard against being possessive and jealous.  Your delight in mystery and your sensitivity to things you do not understand could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, it is difficult for you to retain emotional stability, for you can easily swing into moods of depression and self-pity.  Your quick temper can flare up suddenly and be over as suddenly, leaving you very sorry for any suffering you have caused."
" Although you are honest and fair, a directness in speech is a source of much consternation to you, and you often regret what you say.  You also have a tendency to worry.  It causes you to be too serious, and interferes with happiness and relaxation that comes with naturalness of expression."
" Expression comes easily to you; in fact, you should learn to control it and discipline your expression. You are not practical where money matters are concerned, your theory being that money is there to be spent.  You are kind and generous, and will fill a need when you see it; at times, others take advantage of your generosity. The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
" You can have intensely contrasting feelings toward people, either you are fiercely loyal or extremely intolerant.  There is rarely a happy medium in your feelings.  Consequently, you experience many disappointments in people, tragedy, and the loss of the very things for which you may be intensely striving.  Bitter experiences could make you cynical, critical, and argumentative.  You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation."
" The name is a very practical influence, causing you to take your responsibilities seriously.  At times it is difficult for you to see the lighter or more humourous side of a situation because of your serious attitude.  Your highly capable and efficient nature make it difficult for some people to approach you.  Although you desire to serve your fellow man, you may at times lack tolerance for those who are less self-assured and whose approach to life is not as positive and optimistic as your own.  You are strongly independent and would be happiest when working without supervision, preferably in your own business where you have the challenge of ""standing or falling"" by your own decisions.  A good material standard of living is of utmost importance to you and you are careful to select only the best quality in all your purchases.  You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
" However, this name does not allow you to complete your undertakings, as farther fields always look greener.  Although you may appear confident and positive, you actually lack confidence and feel self-conscious at times.  This name spoils patience and depth of thought, and weakens your stand in matters of principle.  You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence."
"Kind but shy, you appear calm but suffer inwardly from nervous tension that saps your strength.  As a result, you experience moods of depression and self-pity and often avoid facing issues. A lack of confidence leads to procrastination, a need for support and encouragement from others, and a vulnerability to be taken advantage of in many situations."
" You are good-natured, have a good sense of humour, and are fairly easy-going, making friends with those who enjoy a good time.  A weakness of this name is a tendency to make promises which you have difficulty in keeping.  You tend to be lavish in your tastes and to spend your money freely.  You have a heart of gold and are always ready to give generously."
" You are friendly by nature, but you cannot enjoy complete ease in association because of a difficulty in expressing yourself.  While you can be exacting and thorough in whatever you decide to undertake, and desire to keep a well-ordered life with everything in its place, it is not easy for you to maintain the system and order you would like.  There is conflict between your desires and your expression which does not allow scope for your capabilities.  This lack of fulfilment of your deeper qualities tends to create repression and frustration."
 Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences.
"You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" Your insistence on becoming involved in the affairs of others can cause them to regard you as interfering, even though you are only trying to help.  A weakness lies in the fact that you are deeply affected through your feeling for others and could suffer through worry and disturbed thoughts over matters that you can do nothing about.  While you have an appreciation for the finer things of life and could be successful along inspirational as well as business or professional lines of endeavour, there is a tendency to become involved in the needs and interests of others to the detriment of your own progress.  Home and family are important to you and you desire to establish a settled home environment where you can enjoy the congenial companionship of friends and family."
" You lack the necessary aggressiveness for business success.  While you lack verbal expression and spontaneity under this name, you have a natural literary ability and writing comes easily to you.  You also have a deep appreciation of nature and all the finer things in life."
" Your desire for sociability and the pleasant things in life makes you too easily influenced through your associations.  You have imagination and many ideas but you lack the drive or initiative to put these into effect.  It is difficult for you to say ""no"" and mean it or to carry through with any commitments you have made.  This name makes you too lackadaisical.  The influence of this name is to lack practicality, system and order, organizing ability, astuteness, and the ability to make decisions and act upon them.  Due to procrastination you have many unfulfilled desires.  You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
 There is conflict between your desires and your expression which does not allow scope for your capabilities.  This lack of fulfilment of your deeper qualities tends to create repression and frustration.
" For that reason, you would find difficulty in achieving success in positions requiring aggressiveness and quick decisions.  Your inclination is to pursue a line of work where you carry some level of responsibility and diplomacy is required in contact with people.  Others can, at times, take advantage of your gentle nature."
" This name gives you a musical, artistic nature and you would do well in any occupation in the entertainment field.  You have many friends because of your generous, happy nature, but if crossed you have a quick temper, although your annoyance does not last too long.  You do enjoy an argument and will at times say things just to get others going and then you sit back and enjoy the debate.  You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money.  This name creates a nature that can be the life of the party, but many times you can become involved in emotional situations against your better judgment.  Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to."
" Also, this name does not incorporate qualities that enable you to be diplomatic and to compromise.  In all your work and activities you are inclined to be rather unsystematic and disorderly.  These characteristics spoil stability, progress, and accumulation, even though you may put forth intense effort.  Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life."
" You have an appreciation for good music, literature, art, drama, and philosophy, and you could be creative in those fields. An outdoor life also appeals to you and you could find much enjoyment in the beauties of nature.  In the business world, your reserve and outward placidity command respect for your authority.  However, in your personal life, this reserve and reticence are often mistaken for coldness and lack of feeling, with the result that others find it difficult to understand you.  While your name gives you a clever, deep mind, you feel and sense much that you do not fully understand. As it is not easy for you to share your deeper thoughts and ideals with others, you are inclined to choose the association of those few friends with whom you feel the most at ease and with whom you can enjoy companionship in a contemplative mood without feeling pressure for verbal communication."
" In close association you are not often attentive to the needs of others.  It is difficult for you to demonstrate tenderness and warmth and, consequently, personal relationships are not as harmonious as you wish them to be."
" Routine and system are foreign to your life, and, of course, these assets are an integral part of any successful undertaking."
" However, you depend upon others for support and encouragement.  Appreciating quality and knowing the value of money, you desire to be financially successful and to enjoy life's comforts.  You want to make money in easier ways than through arduous work."
" You dislike monotony and system and enjoy being creative in an inventive way whether it be in interior decorating, music, art, crafts, or other endeavours that require versatility and skill.  You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
" You tend to centre your interest too much on whatever means the most to you, and then you become over-possessive and suffer through disillusionment and fear of losses."
" A good material standard of living is of utmost importance to you and you are careful to select only the best quality in all your purchases.  You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
" You are ambitious and aggressive by nature.  You would be happiest in positions where you are free to express individually and creatively and where opportunities are not restricted; you desire freedom, and do not tolerate being possessed by others.  You appreciate change and travel, and the opportunity to meet and mix with others, and to influence them with your creative ideas.  You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses and bitter experiences.  This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association."
" You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
" Peaceful and settled conditions appeal to you and you are naturally desirous of having the security of a home, where your life could follow a definite pattern, and where you would not have to make major decisions.  You find it difficult to take a definite stand, partly because you lack confidence, and also because you dislike any issues which create dissension between people.  Procrastination is a weakness of your nature, causing an inability always to complete your plans or to concentrate for long.  You need to see a concept presented completely in detail before you can understand it, and if you cannot understand it, you come to your own conclusion and often fail to listen to and reason out another's point of view.  You resist being forced into change and could become almost impervious to new ideas.  You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood."
"The weakness of this name could create nervous breakdowns, or disorders related to the nervous system.
"
" Your questioning, critical, practical nature makes you prove all ideas to your own satisfaction, rarely accepting  anyone's word or ideas.  At times you are torn between your desire for system and order and your desire for change and new experiences.  You have to guard against impatience and criticism of the weaknesses of others.  Your impulsive nature could lead to accidents."
 Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences.
" You can be generous and willing to share what you have with others.  Your empathy for the problems of others in social or economic issues, could bring satisfaction from work of a humanitarian nature.  You find it easy to converse with all types of people.  Your desire to possess and direct those closest to you could result in shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships."
" You are thoughtful and considerate of others, dignified yet friendly.  Your ambition is for the stability of settling down, with a nice home, good furniture, and a good standard of living.  You have the business ability and astuteness to attain this standard.  You desire to direct and control finances, both in business and in the home.  You would appreciate the cultural aspects of life such as art and music.  It tends to be too practical an influence causing you to put the practical needs of your home and family ahead of taking the time for the little considerations which create love and understanding.  This name creates a strong, capable nature, able to lead and control, of which you are probably well aware, but it causes a worrying nature.  It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
" You have depth of mind and the ability to concentrate and to follow a line of thought to a logical conclusion.  Your love of challenging the concepts of others invariably leads you to create your own ideas and to pioneer new lines of thought.  Your strong characteristic of individuality qualifies you as a leader.  You must be independent and you do not brook interference in any way.  Although you do not tolerate interference in your own affairs, this characteristic does not prevent you from interfering in the affairs of others.  You are usually either telling or showing someone how to do something properly.  Although you are good-natured and never intend offence, still your blunt, direct, and candid manner of expression strains friendships; your honesty and sincerity earn respect from others.  You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others."
" Also you are sympathetic to the needs of others.  Interested in art, music, singing, dancing, and anything of an artistic nature, you could become a very fine performer. Your spontaneous expression stands you in good stead during arguments or debates, though you are perhaps too outspoken and inclined to sarcasm.  A very real weakness of this name is lack of system and order.  The use of this name makes it extremely difficult to carry through and finish the things you start.  It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.  You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" This name does offer creative talent where there is the opportunity for ingenuity and originality.  You have a tendency, at times, to have too many ideas on the go, and thus your efforts are scattered and many things do not reach completion.  You are inclined to do to excess the things you like to do.  You have very intense feelings and find it difficult to maintain stability and happiness.  If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
" Others sense your sincere interest and desire to help, and you can always be counted on to see the bright side of any problem.  You enjoy making others happy and you never let your own problems ""get you down"" for any length of time, even though you do tend to worry too much at times.  Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.  In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" You have a determined, self-reliant, capable nature and resent any interference, although in your desire to help you are inclined to become involved in the lives and decisions of other people.  You like to make your own decisions and to be the master of your domain.  You feel a limitation in your own expression when it is necessary to reach another through tact and understanding.  Although you are honest and fair, a directness in speech is a source of much consternation to you, and you often regret what you say.  You also have a tendency to worry.  It causes you to be too serious, and interferes with happiness and relaxation that comes with naturalness of expression."
" Self-confidence has made it easy for you to meet people and you are well-liked for your spontaneous, happy ways.  You sincerely like people and do not often experience loneliness; your work and home-life are likely filled with association   You enjoy music and could have a fine singing voice; however, the study could be somewhat difficult because you do not find it easy to apply yourself to concentrated study for long periods.  In this respect, this name is not altogether constructive; it creates a somewhat scattering influence which makes it difficult for you to finish what you start.  This name brings disappointments and emotional involvements through being too sympathetic and easily influenced."
" You would be successful in any position dealing with the public as you have a diplomatic and tactful manner and possess a charming, easy-going nature which puts people at ease.  People are drawn to you because they feel that you are patient, kind, understanding, and responsive.  You would be effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.  While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues."
" Your quiet intensity is difficult for others to understand and thus, you are on guard for fear of being ridiculed or criticized.  Loving the outdoors, you enjoy outside activities and the beauty of nature in its many facets.  Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets."
"This name gives you a versatile, clever, analytical mind, but unfortunately you cannot direct your interest toward an undertaking for long, as you do not have the patience and practicality for systematic hard work and attention to detail.  You resent obstacles, delays, and restrictions. This name gives you ambition, high ideals, and much creative ability, but the intense dynamic nature is too often spent in feelings and in moods, rather than in constructive action.  You desire to be your own boss, yet you find it difficult to stabilize your life and to settle down and be accumulative.  Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.  You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" When under stress, you can become overbearing and belittling in your attitude to others, and inclined to express sarcasm and temper.  Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own world of personal relationships or material possessions, you could suffer disappointments with those close to you, unfulfilled ideals, or material losses."
"The weakness of this name is in worry, which in turn affects the nervous system, creating a tendency to be highly strung or over-sensitive to the thoughts of others."
" A very real weakness of this name is lack of system and order.  The use of this name makes it extremely difficult to carry through and finish the things you start.  It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.  You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" Yours is a very deep, reflective nature, but others would never know it as you keep your deeper feelings within."
" You could do well in public relations work.  You have a good business sense, but tend to procrastinate and get involved with people who could interfere with your carrying your endeavours to a proper close.  Although you have many good plans, can visualize their workings, and have the best of intentions, planning is often as far as you get.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  Your emotional nature at times does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, and you experience entanglements that could prove awkward and embarrassing."
" It is not easy for you to take advice, subsequently; you tend to work alone or independently.  You suffer inner turmoil and moods at times especially when you feel misunderstood, and being extremely sensitive, you are easily hurt and offended.  Your quiet intensity is difficult for others to understand and thus, you are on guard for fear of being ridiculed or criticized.  Loving the outdoors, you enjoy outside activities and the beauty of nature in its many facets.  Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets."
" You would find electricity, electronics, and similar technical fields of interest, as well as computer, mathematical, and scientific studies.  You are inclined to be quiet, reserved, patient, and conservative, preferring to test and prove everything to your own satisfaction before committing yourself.  You like to finish what you start without interruptions, and also to have everything in its place and properly organized.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative.  As a result, you seem aloof.  Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
" With this name, you desire the finer things in life, but you do not always have the resolve and vitality to put forth the effort necessary to fulfil your desires. Your emotional feelings are easily aroused and you will always be involved in other people's problems as a result of your overly sympathetic nature. You have many disappointments because of extending a helping hand to others in need, and then not receiving any acknowledgement or reciprocation for your generosity.  After each experience, you have to guard against feelings of despondency and self-pity. You have high goals and ideals, but must incorporate more practicality, system, and concentration in order to materialize them."
" Spontaneous, happy-go-lucky, and expressive yourself, you like to see people happy and go out of your way to create harmony amongst them.  You find it difficult to discipline your desires and emotional feelings.  Too idealistic and impractical through the use of this name, you would not find it easy to make a success in the business world.  You are inclined to procrastinate and let things slide and to make promises that you find difficult to fulfil although you have the best of intentions."
" You are astute regarding the value of money, have good business judgment, and can drive a hard bargain if such is required. This name has not allowed you to express fully the softer, more spontaneous qualities of your nature because of its practical business attributes.  You are matter-of-fact in your attitude to things, not easily swayed by others, nor overly compassionate to the suffering of others.  You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
" You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself.  You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence."
"Your judgment is seldom swayed through your feelings. You have definite executive and leadership abilities, however others may find you to be rather forceful and uncompromising. More congenial business and personal relationships would result from being more tactful and more aware of the needs of others. If you sacrifice too much for material ambition, there may result a lack of harmony and balance in your personal life."
" You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature.  In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
 Your desire to possess and direct those closest to you could result in shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships.
" The influence of this name does not promote the friendship that you desire or the relaxation and naturalness you should enjoy with people.  It is a name that makes you far too practical and serious-minded, and makes it difficult for you to act with spontaneity."
"This name makes you nervous and highly strung, causing tension affecting your nervous system and solar plexus."
" You have always been a happy person, and, desiring to see others happy as well, you strive to inspire others, which you do most effectively through an engaging sense of humour.  You are fond of surprises and are quick to respond to spontaneous invitations which promise a good time, particularly when they relieve you of a boring task.  Your dislike for monotony and routine, often means that you do not finish the things you start.  A natural rhythm, a sense of colour harmony, and creative ability contribute to a flair for composition and artistic and musical expression.  Expression comes easily to you; in fact, you should learn to control it and discipline your expression. You are not practical where money matters are concerned, your theory being that money is there to be spent.  You are kind and generous, and will fill a need when you see it; at times, others take advantage of your generosity. The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
" There is a seriousness to your nature which could cause you to worry over your responsibilities, especially when confronted with change and uncertainty."
"From a desire to eat too many rich foods, your health could suffer through kidney and generative troubles or any problems affecting the fluid functions of the body."
" Creating an impression of affluence and prestige is important to you.  From a very early age your ambitions have been directed towards the accumulation of material wealth.  You can be generous and willing to share what you have with others.  Your empathy for the problems of others in social or economic issues, could bring satisfaction from work of a humanitarian nature.  You find it easy to converse with all types of people.  Your desire to possess and direct those closest to you could result in shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships."
" You cannot find peace of mind or lasting contentment in anything you do.  As soon as a challenge is met, boredom sets in, and you yearn for another experience.  This restlessness makes it difficult for you to assume responsibility and to establish stable, progressive conditions in your life.  You could do well in sales work or in meeting the public where quickness of mind and expression are all important.  You have many friends, but lose interest in people very quickly.  Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.  Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences."
" People may consider you haughty and aloof because of your sensitivity and reserved ways.  You may find some expression abut it would usually be light conversation, rarely daring to reveal your deeper thoughts or take others into your confidence for fear of criticism or ridicule.  You have a very kind and gentle nature, and although you may be in a position in contact with the public, you will still be a lonely and reserved person.  Thus, you live much within your own thoughts, often finding your escape in reading, which you love to do."
" Despite your loyalty to friends, your communication at times is stilted, too candid, and frank."
"Under very stressful conditions, you could suffer through nervous breakdowns, as well as disturbing thoughts, which could affect your concentration and memory. Also, disorders in the fluid functions could arise."
" From a very early age your ambitions have been directed towards the accumulation of material wealth.  You can be generous and willing to share what you have with others.  Your empathy for the problems of others in social or economic issues, could bring satisfaction from work of a humanitarian nature.  You find it easy to converse with all types of people.  Your desire to possess and direct those closest to you could result in shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships."
" In a large group of comparative strangers, you are quiet and rather shy, unable to express yourself, not really wanting to become involved in conversation.  On the other hand, among friends with whom you feel at ease, you are expressive, witty, and quite charming.  These contrasting natures make it difficult for people to understand you and can lead to friction in your personal life.  You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed and self-pitying over any real or imagined slight.  If you are not careful, people take advantage of your generous nature.  You find the beauties of nature, fine music, art, and literature--all the deeper things of life--inspiring.  The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding."
" You have had the desire to accomplish something outstanding and to do something very worthwhile for humanity, especially early in your life. This name gives you a versatile, clever, analytical mind, but unfortunately you cannot direct your interest toward an undertaking for long, as you do not have the patience and practicality for systematic hard work and attention to detail.  You resent obstacles, delays, and restrictions. This name gives you ambition, high ideals, and much creative ability, but the intense dynamic nature is too often spent in feelings and in moods, rather than in constructive action.  You desire to be your own boss, yet you find it difficult to stabilize your life and to settle down and be accumulative.  Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.  You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
 Procrastination is your downfall.  You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition.
"Generally speaking, you have few problems with your health; however, there is a weakness affecting the fluid functions of the body."
" You dislike heavy manual work; as well, you are inclined to put plans off until forced to take action.  You find it difficult to be systematic in business and you dislike budgeting.  Without the encouragement of others, you lack the energy, confidence, or initiative required to bring an idea to fruition."
" You love change, travel, and new opportunities and dislike monotonous detail.  Though you show enthusiasm over a new-found interest, you seldom finish the things you start.  If you are repressed or restricted in any way, you become frustrated, moody, and depressed.  You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" Desiring to be free from detail and monotony, you find it difficult to finish what you start if it does not hold your interest.  You enjoy reading and the beauties of nature, experiencing peace and relaxation in outdoor activities.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  With acquaintances and strangers, you tend to be reticent and reserved.  Your friends never know whether they will find you friendly and charming or lost in introspection.  When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
"Also, should you over-indulge in sweet, rich foods you could experience skin or liver problems."
"Others are inclined to take advantage of your generosity and friendliness and then, when there is a lack of reciprocation, you can feel despondent and disillusioned. Moods are a problem as you can be highly inspired one minute, and the next become quite irritated and annoyed over some ill-timed remark or lack of consideration on the part of someone close to you."
" You can be very analytical, exacting, and patient as long as there is a challenge holding your interest, such as in the field of computers with its technical challenge.  When your interest is exhausted, you switch to something else even though it means leaving your undertakings unfinished.  This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  This skepticism has not protected you from many disappointments when people you have trusted have let you down."
" On occasion, you can be intolerant and critical of others, quick to argue and to dominate situations.  Though the name offers a fair degree of balance, you would have to watch that strong appetites do not find an outlet through excessive eating, causing overweight and resultant problems, or through emotional experiences which could create unsettled conditions in your personal life."
" This name creates a strong, capable nature, able to lead and control, of which you are probably well aware, but it causes a worrying nature.  It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
" You budget your personal finances very carefully.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair.  This name limits imagination, flexibility, responsiveness, and spontaneity in your nature.  It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures."
"The use of this name can cause weak ankles, a strong desire for such foods as sweets or pickles, which causes skin or liver troubles, and a desire to eat too quickly."
" Although you meet new people easily, it is not easy for you to maintain a relaxed, harmonious relationship.  With increased familiarity you are inclined to speak your mind in a forthright, sometimes argumentative manner which creates annoyance and often hard feelings.  In an argument, you usually emerge victor, but at a cost.  This name does not offer the softness of expression for long-lasting compatibility in close associations."
" You pursue your undertakings on a grand scale, based on your business acumen and ability to visualize an overall plan.  Your enthusiasm, aggressiveness, and salesmanship are often sufficient to bring about fulfillment of your ambitions.  However, in the attempt to impress others with the scope of your success, you can over-extend your resources to the point that you have inadequate means to cover your basic expenses.  There are times when you would be advised to start in a smaller way, and gradually reach your desired level of success through perseverance, patience, and attention to details.  When things are going well, you have a generous, magnanimous nature, ready to offer support and assistance to others.  When under stress, you can become overbearing and belittling in your attitude to others, and inclined to express sarcasm and temper.  Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own world of personal relationships or material possessions, you could suffer disappointments with those close to you, unfulfilled ideals, or material losses."
"Since you are not inclined to give due consideration to practical and business matters, you could miss out on reaching a level of financial success appropriate for your efforts and abilities. You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand, and you can be deeply influenced through the thoughts of others without realizing just how you are being affected. Others are inclined to take advantage of your generosity and friendliness and then, when there is a lack of reciprocation, you can feel despondent and disillusioned. Moods are a problem as you can be highly inspired one minute, and the next become quite irritated and annoyed over some ill-timed remark or lack of consideration on the part of someone close to you."
" Others often find it difficult to understand you.  Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."
" For this reason, you could do well in public relations work.  You appreciate the finer things of life, and like to have a good standard of living.  You feel that it is important to convey the impression that you are financially secure, and you place importance on your mode of dress, and on appearances generally.  While you could do well in certain positions of authority, you have a certain lack of initiative and a tendency to procrastinate.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work. However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
" This name makes you very idealistic, emotional, and temperamental, liking to do things on the spur-of-the-moment and disliking being repressed or held down to monotonous detail.  A lack of  concentration makes it difficult to establish stable, secure conditions in your business life.  In order to bring out the higher side of your nature, you should develop your artistic and creative talents."
" There are artistic, creative abilities in this name that you could express through music or singing, or, in a practical way, through sewing or interior decorating.  You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature.  In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
" You will do anything to avoid friction among others.  You could have musical or artistic talents but find it difficult to concentrate your efforts in one area long enough to accomplish anything.  Spontaneous, happy-go-lucky, and expressive yourself, you like to see people happy and go out of your way to create harmony amongst them.  You find it difficult to discipline your desires and emotional feelings.  Too idealistic and impractical through the use of this name, you would not find it easy to make a success in the business world.  You are inclined to procrastinate and let things slide and to make promises that you find difficult to fulfil although you have the best of intentions."
" You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing much turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in conversation with those with whom you are not well-acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative with new acquaintances or in a large crowd.  As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly.  You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
" Thus your success in your undertakings is limited.  The tasks or activities you enjoy the most allow some form of creative or artistic expression.  You will never tolerate a situation where your independence and individuality are curtailed.  Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
" You would appreciate the cultural aspects of life such as art and music.  It tends to be too practical an influence causing you to put the practical needs of your home and family ahead of taking the time for the little considerations which create love and understanding.  This name creates a strong, capable nature, able to lead and control, of which you are probably well aware, but it causes a worrying nature.  It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
" These characteristics spoil stability, progress, and accumulation, even though you may put forth intense effort.  Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life."
Weaknesses in the health caused by this name centre in the head.
" As soon as a challenge is met, boredom sets in, and you yearn for another experience.  This restlessness makes it difficult for you to assume responsibility and to establish stable, progressive conditions in your life.  You could do well in sales work or in meeting the public where quickness of mind and expression are all important.  You have many friends, but lose interest in people very quickly.  Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.  Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences."
" You can give expression to your personal thoughts and feelings most fluently through the written word.  You have a sensitive nature--sensitive to your environment and particularly sensitive to how your deeper and more serious interests are regarded by others.  Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
 You could express your thoughts more easily in writing than in speaking.  You seldom experience the peace of mind that comes with composed thinking and emotional control.
 You are inclined to pursue good times and emotional indulgences to excess.
"This name causes tension in the region of the solar plexus, as well as the heart and lungs.  Health problems would centre in those areas of the body."
" This name does not allow you the system and order your life requires to run in a smooth, efficient way, and if possible you will avoid having to make decisions because you feel much more secure when you can lean on others.  Many times you make promises you do not keep, although your intentions are always good."
" You tend to be thorough in building a solid foundation of fact and logic, but you are not especially imaginative or investigative.  You are particular and quite set in your way you want things to be done.  Once you have made up your mind or formed an opinion it is not easily changed.  Hence there is a restriction in friendships and business opportunities."
"This name causes tension to affect your heart and respiratory organs, resulting in colds or bronchial conditions."
" You like activities that require physical effort as well as mental ingenuity.  Your questioning, critical, practical nature makes you prove all ideas to your own satisfaction, rarely accepting  anyone's word or ideas.  At times you are torn between your desire for system and order and your desire for change and new experiences.  You have to guard against impatience and criticism of the weaknesses of others.  Your impulsive nature could lead to accidents."
" You find it difficult to make snap decisions and to occupy a leadership position as you lack self-confidence.  You dislike heavy manual work; as well, you are inclined to put plans off until forced to take action.  You find it difficult to be systematic in business and you dislike budgeting.  Without the encouragement of others, you lack the energy, confidence, or initiative required to bring an idea to fruition."
"You have definite executive and leadership abilities, however others may find you to be rather forceful and uncompromising. More congenial business and personal relationships would result from being more tactful and more aware of the needs of others. If you sacrifice too much for material ambition, there may result a lack of harmony and balance in your personal life."
"Your intense, restless nature can bring on tension which affects the solar plexus and digestion, or the female organs."
"You enjoy sweets and starchy foods.  Over-indulgence could cause a weak back, skin conditions or arthritis later in life.  The heart and lungs could also be affected at stressful times."
" In order to bring out the higher side of your nature, you should develop your artistic and creative talents."
" It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence."
" Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
" You have a good business sense, but tend to procrastinate and get involved with people who could interfere with your carrying your endeavours to a proper close.  Although you have many good plans, can visualize their workings, and have the best of intentions, planning is often as far as you get.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  Your emotional nature at times does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, and you experience entanglements that could prove awkward and embarrassing."
" The tasks or activities you enjoy the most allow some form of creative or artistic expression.  You will never tolerate a situation where your independence and individuality are curtailed.  Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
"Physical weaknesses would show in your heart, lungs, or bronchial area."
" You like to make your own decisions and to be the master of your domain.  You feel a limitation in your own expression when it is necessary to reach another through tact and understanding.  Although you are honest and fair, a directness in speech is a source of much consternation to you, and you often regret what you say.  You also have a tendency to worry.  It causes you to be too serious, and interferes with happiness and relaxation that comes with naturalness of expression."
" You have very intense feelings and find it difficult to maintain stability and happiness.  If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
" This name has made you rather aggressive, shrewd, and critical and has caused you to be extremely independent.  You have the analysis, vision, and promotional ability to make progress.  You could achieve heights of success in business, but there is also a factor which brings many forced changes and friction with people, which in turn offsets the success you could achieve.  The more sensitive types of people find you overpowering at times.  You tend to have too many irons in the fire and fail to complete your undertakings satisfactorily.  Business success could be achieved, to a point, abut your personal life would suffer.  It is not easy for you to relax because you feel so much drive."
 Others may see you as rather shrewd and calculating.
 Through your diplomatic ways you are able to call on the assistance of others to avoid such matters.  You have good business judgment but lack the confidence to carry out your own ideas unless assisted by an associate.
" With this name, success to you is a foregone conclusion, for you cannot conceive any reason for not reaching all your goals, as you have self-sufficiency, supreme confidence, boundless energy, and enthusiasm.  As long as you have a sense of freedom from monotony and drudgery, and can see progress being made, you feel buoyant and optimistic.  However, obstacles and frustration can give rise to feelings of impatience, intolerance, and depression.  The ever-present desire to progress does not allow you proper relaxation or the proper expression of the softer feminine qualities of sympathy, encouragement, and affection.  Others may see you as rather shrewd and calculating."
" The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding."
" Your sensitivity and reserve prevent people from coming close in friendship.  There is always an aloofness and reserve that acts as a barrier and prevents any close ties. You live much within your own thoughts, and seek relaxation away from people, out in nature, where you can ease the tensions of your life.  You find it difficult to express your true feelings, whether it be affection, appreciation, or tenderness, which play such an important part in creating a close bond within the family."
" This name creates a pleasant, easy-going, and responsible nature.  You are good natured and affectionate and enjoy home and family life.  You tend to avoid issues, however, and put off until tomorrow decisions that should be made today.  For that reason, you would find difficulty in achieving success in positions requiring aggressiveness and quick decisions.  Your inclination is to pursue a line of work where you carry some level of responsibility and diplomacy is required in contact with people.  Others can, at times, take advantage of your gentle nature."
" You do rely on the support and encouragement of others as there is an underlying lack of confidence with this name. For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions."
"Health weaknesses affect the intestinal tract and associated disorders.  There is also a weakness in the fluid functions of the body, causing either swelling of the legs and ankles, phlebitis, or varicose veins."
" Your desire for independence and freedom means that you seldom tolerate limitations.  Although you are naturally happy and generous, you fail to hold friendships because you are inclined to be too dogmatic, argumentative, or sarcastic.  In an argument, you usually emerge the victor, but at a cost."
" You are quick to size up others, and this appraisal is based upon their physical appearance, their clothes, and whether they have achieved material success and the standards of quality that you have set in your own mind.  You have a keen business sense, knowing a lucrative proposition when it is presented, and it is likely others would come to you for business counsel.  You are a capable leader and organizer who should never be in a subordinate position.  You have the ability to organize and see the whole picture where any prospective business venture is concerned.  It is a name, however, which almost destroys the finer, sensitive qualities that should be expressed.  It makes spontaneous, natural expression difficult.  Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs."
" Although you desire to create harmony in your associations, you can be too candid in your expression, especially if you are challenged by others.  Then you can be quietly stubborn and resist taking advice.  You want to be more expressive, diplomatic, and easy-going, but you feel the limitation in your communication with others and it creates frustration within you."
"Physically you could suffer through tension in the heart, lungs, or bronchial area, and also through intestinal problems."
" You feel that it is important to convey the impression that you are financially secure, and you place importance on your mode of dress, and on appearances generally.  While you could do well in certain positions of authority, you have a certain lack of initiative and a tendency to procrastinate.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work. However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
  You enjoy outdoors activities with a few close friends.
"Nervous tension often affects your solar plexus and stomach area.  Also, the kidneys and fluid functions of the body could be affected."
" Yet, you are sensitive and very easily hurt and offended.  You long for praise and appreciation for your efforts, but others find it difficult to understand you.  You dislike monotony and system and enjoy being creative in an inventive way whether it be in interior decorating, music, art, crafts, or other endeavours that require versatility and skill.  You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
"The opposing forces in your nature affect your nervous system, causing tension in the solar plexus, indigestion, ulcers, or growths, and moods of depression.  You have not found the happiness nor the settled conditions you desire."
"Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
" It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
 Home and family are important to you and you desire to establish a settled home environment where you can enjoy the congenial companionship of friends and family.
" You are inclined to be quiet, reserved, patient, and conservative, preferring to test and prove everything to your own satisfaction before committing yourself.  You like to finish what you start without interruptions, and also to have everything in its place and properly organized.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative.  As a result, you seem aloof.  Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
" You feel and sense much more than you can fully understand, and could become psychic if you delved into the occult.  The problem then would be controllable thoughts, feelings, and reactions.  You find it difficult to be patient, practical, and systematic, preferring to act impulsively as the spirit moves you."
" Your over-cautious nature allows many promising opportunities to slip by.  Conserving finances and material possessions, you maintain your home at a good standard, and treat all family responsibility seriously.  Though reserved in showing affection you are a considerate person."
" This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people.  The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
" Your infinite patience would allow you to develop intricate, involved skills to perfection. Often feeling burdened with work, you worry about details out of proportion to their importance.  Having definite ideas, you are skeptical and do not change easily, for you require proof, preferably in complete detail before you will alter an opinion.  Once you are settled into a situation, you do not like to move or make changes.  When on a schedule, you follow it implicitly. Your sense of values emphasizes material things, with little appreciation towards the more artistic, philosophical, or inspirational matters."
"The physical weaknesses due to this name centre in the fluids of the body and the senses of the head, causing headaches, eye, teeth, or severe sinus conditions; also, kidney or bladder weaknesses."
" You are quite reserved and inclined to feel sensitive and self-conscious, even though you strive to appear poised and confident.  Being rather secretive in many ways, and not liking people to pry into your affairs restrict opportunities for friendship; not until you feel you can trust others do you open up to them.  The desire to help others and the generous side of your nature attract those who take advantage of you.  You lack the necessary aggressiveness for business success.  While you lack verbal expression and spontaneity under this name, you have a natural literary ability and writing comes easily to you.  You also have a deep appreciation of nature and all the finer things in life."
" You are good-natured and likeable, and people tend to confide in you and seek your advice in personal problems.  Others sense your sincere interest and desire to help, and you can always be counted on to see the bright side of any problem.  You enjoy making others happy and you never let your own problems ""get you down"" for any length of time, even though you do tend to worry too much at times.  Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.  In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" At times you are motivated more by moods and desires than by sound logic and reason, and under conditions of stress you could react inadvertently in temper or stubbornness that you would regret later."
"The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
"Tension could affect the eyes, ears, teeth, or sinuses.  Frequent head colds or severe headaches are potential problems.
"
" You cannot tolerate any domination by others, or circumstances that restrict your freedom and independence.  You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions.  When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.  Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.  Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be."
" You are creative, versatile, and imaginative.  However, independence, positivity and the urge for action and progress are such strong forces in your nature that you find it difficult to control them.  You feel happy as long as headway is being made, but as soon as you are obstructed or your individuality and freedom of action are restricted, you experience an intense nervous reaction.  Moods of depression can result during which you become caustic and belligerent in your attitude toward everyone, especially to those in closest association with you.  Routine, monotony, and the responsibility of looking after details can have a similar effect on you, as you are a person who desires change, travel, and new experiences.  In order to gain greater congeniality in your personal associations, you need to cultivate a more relaxed manner, greater generosity, understanding, and tolerance, and, above all, you need to avoid being too outspoken and self-opinionated."
" Whatever you set out to accomplish you do your very best to complete in accordance with what you consider to be right.  In the home you assume your responsibilities capably, having the self-confidence to form your own opinions and make your own decisions.  Others can rely on you; once you have given your word you will do your utmost to fulfil a responsibility.  However, there is a tendency to be a little too independent in your thinking and it is difficult for you to accept the help of others when you should."
" Without the encouragement of others, you lack the energy, confidence, or initiative required to bring an idea to fruition."
"Your fondness for excess quantities of heavy, starchy foods could cause stomach or intestinal disorders; you could also suffer with head tension, affecting the eyes, ears, sinus, throat, or loss of hair."
" You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself.  You could work well in sales and promotion, and would not be afraid to risk a gamble as the name gives you much self-confidence.  You do not find contentment in the routine tasks and responsibilities that are associated with home and family or with administrative detail in the business world, so you have to guard against frustration and even moods of depression over your personal responsibilities.  The restlessness this name creates could find an outlet in caustic, irritable expression."
" You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" You have a pleasure-loving nature, and although you have an ability to meet and mix with people on all levels, you tend to become involved in awkward emotional situations to your detriment.  Deriving pleasure from giving to others, you enjoy spending money on them, but tend to be a spendthrift, and not build up a reserve for emergencies."
" Since you are quick and fluent in your expression, you have to guard against boastfulness or dominating a situation."
" Self-consciousness may prevent you from feeling at ease in positions of impromptu expression.  Desiring to be free from detail and monotony, you find it difficult to finish what you start if it does not hold your interest.  You enjoy reading and the beauties of nature, experiencing peace and relaxation in outdoor activities.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  With acquaintances and strangers, you tend to be reticent and reserved.  Your friends never know whether they will find you friendly and charming or lost in introspection.  When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" You have the business ability and astuteness to attain this standard.  You desire to direct and control finances, both in business and in the home.  You would appreciate the cultural aspects of life such as art and music.  It tends to be too practical an influence causing you to put the practical needs of your home and family ahead of taking the time for the little considerations which create love and understanding.  This name creates a strong, capable nature, able to lead and control, of which you are probably well aware, but it causes a worrying nature.  It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
" In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" However, procrastination is your worst enemy, and you find yourself lacking the ambition to make your dreams a reality.  People are inclined to take advantage of your sympathetic, tractable nature.  You naturally attract people with problems who seek your understanding and advice.  You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself.  You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence."
" You could do well working with the public giving advice, where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  You find it difficult to make snap decisions and to occupy a leadership position as you lack self-confidence.  You dislike heavy manual work; as well, you are inclined to put plans off until forced to take action.  You find it difficult to be systematic in business and you dislike budgeting.  Without the encouragement of others, you lack the energy, confidence, or initiative required to bring an idea to fruition."
" You desire a high standard of living and the best quality in material possessions.  Creating an impression of affluence and prestige is important to you.  From a very early age your ambitions have been directed towards the accumulation of material wealth.  You can be generous and willing to share what you have with others.  Your empathy for the problems of others in social or economic issues, could bring satisfaction from work of a humanitarian nature.  You find it easy to converse with all types of people.  Your desire to possess and direct those closest to you could result in shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Uncontrolled outbursts of temper could cause problems in close personal relationships."
" You enjoy unexpected opportunities for meeting people, or doing things on the spur of the moment.  Where you have difficulty is in organizing and systematizing the handling of your responsibilities.  Though you can work on any undertaking intently as long as it absorbs your interest, you cannot persevere when confronted by obstacles or by tedious monotony.  Thus your success in your undertakings is limited.  The tasks or activities you enjoy the most allow some form of creative or artistic expression.  You will never tolerate a situation where your independence and individuality are curtailed.  Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
 You are loyal in friendships and express candidly.   You enjoy outdoors activities with a few close friends.
" This name also gives you an appreciation of art, music, drama, or any of the many forms of expression in the arts.  Since you are quick and fluent in your expression, you have to guard against boastfulness or dominating a situation."
" Your expressive, affectionate nature responds very quickly through your feelings, but you must guard against being possessive and jealous.  You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand and cannot express.  Your delight in mystery could draw you into occult studies or religions.  Unfortunately, uncontrolled thoughts make it difficult for you to retain emotional stability, and prevent you from finding proper peace and relaxation.  You tend to centre your interest too much on whatever means the most to you, and then you become over-possessive and suffer through disillusionment and fear of losses."
" A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
" Although you are easily offended by others, you do not show it.  You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof.  The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
" You are always well-groomed yourself, and you judge others by your own standard.  You do not like to rough it or use much physical energy.  Through your diplomatic ways you are able to call on the assistance of others to avoid such matters.  You have good business judgment but lack the confidence to carry out your own ideas unless assisted by an associate."
"A desire for sweet, rich foods could create skin problems, overweight, or you could suffer weakness across the back, or possibly a liver ailment."
"A fondness for heavy, rich foods could, through overeating, cause you to suffer through intestinal and digestive troubles."
" Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair.  This name limits imagination, flexibility, responsiveness, and spontaneity in your nature.  It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures."
" You would function best in settled conditions where you are not called upon to meet and mix too closely with others, but are able to work on your own.  This name restricts congenial expression and association, creating much aloneness.  You could express your thoughts more easily in writing than in speaking.  You seldom experience the peace of mind that comes with composed thinking and emotional control."
" You always have new ideas, but too often they are for an easy way out of a difficulty, or an easy way of making money.  You are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job and to reach the fulfilment of your goals through perseverance and hard work.  The influence of this name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally.  You are never satisfied with conditions, because your feelings and desires are so changeable.  Hence you seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.  There are people in your association who could influence you unfavourably and thereby mislead you; disillusionment, embarrassment, and bitter experiences then become your lot.  You have a very talkative nature and because of it, you could do well in saleswork or in a position where you handle the public.  However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
" Your feelings are very easily hurt and to protect yourself you withdraw within the realms of your own private thoughts and shut out the rest of the world.  Moods, which are your worst enemy, result.  Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature."
" You enjoy making others happy and you never let your own problems ""get you down"" for any length of time, even though you do tend to worry too much at times.  Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.  In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.  However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
" You love people and desire to get along with everyone you meet.  Your desire for sociability and the pleasant things in life makes you too easily influenced through your associations.  You have imagination and many ideas but you lack the drive or initiative to put these into effect.  It is difficult for you to say ""no"" and mean it or to carry through with any commitments you have made.  This name makes you too lackadaisical.  The influence of this name is to lack practicality, system and order, organizing ability, astuteness, and the ability to make decisions and act upon them.  Due to procrastination you have many unfulfilled desires.  You often lean upon the strength of those around you for guidance.  You appreciate the finer things in life such as good clothes, pleasant surroundings, and friendly companions.  You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards."
" You have a very responsible nature, are capable and mature, and are willing to assume a position as a pillar of the community."
"Also, the intensity of your nature could result in tension in the solar plexus causing stomach trouble and, because you take your responsibilities seriously you could experience much worry."
" While you are creative, inventive, and ingenious in practical matters, and always ready to initiate and promote new undertakings, you often experience difficulty in bringing your undertakings to a successful conclusion because of your own changing interests or changing circumstances.  You become intensely involved with everything you plan to do, but the stress arising from frustrating obstacles or misunderstandings with others could prompt you to be intolerant and sarcastic in your expression, with breakdowns in congenial relations with family and friends a possible end result."
" Friends and associates may detect a lack of feeling and sympathy in their relationship with you.  You see the practical side of situations and tend to deal with problems in an objective, sensible, and systematic way.  That is your way of helping others through challenging situations.  Being self-sufficient, you must remember that thoughtful expressions of affection toward those close to you are important.  You express your appreciation for others by what you do for them rather than by what you say.  Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
 You like to do things on the spur of the moment without planning or prior arrangements.  Your spirits are buoyed up greatly by encouragement and appreciation.  There is a tendency to be scattering in your efforts and you prefer to avoid menial jobs of a routine and repetitive nature.  You are inclined to pursue good times and emotional indulgences to excess.
" You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.  You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
" In association your tendency to state your mind simply and clearly, without diplomacy or finesse, can lead to awkwardness or embarrassment."
" It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
"This name would cause tension affecting the eyes, teeth, sinuses, ears or throat troubles; there could also be sensitivity in the heart, lungs, and respiratory organs, and frequent headaches.
"
" It is difficult for you to merge your nature with others to create understanding, or to show love and tenderness to those close to you.  You experience much misunderstanding and unhappiness in your personal life as a result."
" Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own world of personal relationships or material possessions, you could suffer disappointments with those close to you, unfulfilled ideals, or material losses."
" You are fond of home and children and desire a settled environment.  You have an appreciation for music and art, and could express along these lines."
" You have an eye for quality, desiring always the very best that money can buy, and you are not content with anything that is second best.  You are quick to size up others, and this appraisal is based upon their physical appearance, their clothes, and whether they have achieved material success and the standards of quality that you have set in your own mind.  You have a keen business sense, knowing a lucrative proposition when it is presented, and it is likely others would come to you for business counsel.  You are a capable leader and organizer who should never be in a subordinate position.  You have the ability to organize and see the whole picture where any prospective business venture is concerned.  It is a name, however, which almost destroys the finer, sensitive qualities that should be expressed.  It makes spontaneous, natural expression difficult.  Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs."
" As a result, people find it difficult to understand you and you suffer through loneliness.  You are interested in understanding life along scientific, religious, and philosophical lines.  Also, you derive much enjoyment from reading and from being out in nature.  At times, you find it easier to express your thoughts in writing, rather than verbally.  You are astute regarding the value of money, have good business judgment, and can drive a hard bargain if such is required. This name has not allowed you to express fully the softer, more spontaneous qualities of your nature because of its practical business attributes.  You are matter-of-fact in your attitude to things, not easily swayed by others, nor overly compassionate to the suffering of others.  You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
"Health weaknesses of this name affect the stomach and intestinal tract.   Arthritis, or rheumatism could result."
" As a result of your love of the out-of-doors, you would experience the most peace and harmony out in the quiet of nature.  Your sensitive nature causes you to lack self-confidence, and to withdraw from arguments or turmoil, as any discord reflects quickly through your nervous system.  You cannot stand pressure and desire to work where there is no confusion.  This name restricts proper verbal expression; as a result, you are often lonely, craving understanding of others.  Yours is a very deep, reflective nature, but others would never know it as you keep your deeper feelings within."
"Problems with your health centre in your head and you could suffer with head tension, head colds, headaches, and sinus congestion.  There is a strong tendency for you to worry."
 You do not readily change your ideas unless you are thoroughly convinced that you must.
"You are prone to suffer moods of depression, and physical and mental tension which could have a serious affect upon the nervous system, causing stomach ulcers. Health weaknesses could also affect the eyes, ears, sinuses, or result in loss of hair."
" Your pleasant manner attracts people to you with their problems and you are capable of offering practical advice, though you would probably not follow such advice yourself.  This name causes you to be somewhat too concerned with the personalities, problems, and activities of other people.  You seem positive and decisive and can be outspoken in the expression of your opinions, but you lack the self-confidence needed to follow through with your ideas and plans.  Procrastination is your downfall.  You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition."
" Your methodical nature requires that you like to finish what you start without interruptions and also to have everything in its place and properly organized.  An ability to concentrate could take you into computer programming or accountancy or any work requiring concentration and attention to detail.  You have, also, a flair for creative expression with your hands.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing much turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in conversation with those with whom you are not well-acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative with new acquaintances or in a large crowd.  As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly.  You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
" One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
" Obstacles to your progress or restrictions on your freedom to act create a sense of frustration which may cause you to feel resentful and even rebellious.  You can then become intolerant of others, and caustic and belittling in your expression, thereby imposing stress on your personal relationships.  Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people.  Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents."
" Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents.  Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts."
" You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.  There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
"You enjoy working with and organizing the efforts of others, but sometimes, a lack of confidence, indecisiveness, and even idleness can spoil your initiatives.  However, you depend upon others for support and encouragement.  Appreciating quality and knowing the value of money, you desire to be financially successful and to enjoy life's comforts.  You want to make money in easier ways than through arduous work."
" You have intense urges and feelings for which you can find no expression.  At times you are motivated more by moods and desires than by sound logic and reason, and under conditions of stress you could react inadvertently in temper or stubbornness that you would regret later."
" Others find it difficult to accept your domineering and, at times, argumentative manner.  Your circle of friends is restricted to those of like nature.  Once friendship is established, you are very loyal and steadfast and do not tolerate gossip or criticism.  In your close associations and family life, there is little demonstration of sentiment, appreciation, sympathy, or encouragement.  It is difficult for you to find the right words for such circumstances."
 This skepticism has not protected you from many disappointments when people you have trusted have let you down.
" You are able to retain facts, to grasp new information to your existing store of knowledge.  You never seem to be out of your depth of understanding.  For these reasons others who may not have the same quickness of mind classify you as a ""know it all"" and, although you may be highly respected, this characteristic is unlikely to endear you to your associates.  You have a very responsible nature, are capable and mature, and are willing to assume a position as a pillar of the community."
 You often need encouragement from someone before you can come to a decision.
" You must be independent and you do not brook interference in any way.  Although you do not tolerate interference in your own affairs, this characteristic does not prevent you from interfering in the affairs of others.  You are usually either telling or showing someone how to do something properly.  Although you are good-natured and never intend offence, still your blunt, direct, and candid manner of expression strains friendships; your honesty and sincerity earn respect from others.  You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others."
" Conserving finances and material possessions, you maintain your home at a good standard, and treat all family responsibility seriously.  Though reserved in showing affection you are a considerate person."
" The problem then would be controllable thoughts, feelings, and reactions.  You find it difficult to be patient, practical, and systematic, preferring to act impulsively as the spirit moves you."
" You have an appreciation for all the fine and beautiful things in life, and could excel in music, art, drama, or literary undertakings, where you could find an expression for your deeper feelings that you would not find otherwise.  As a result of your love of the out-of-doors, you would experience the most peace and harmony out in the quiet of nature.  Your sensitive nature causes you to lack self-confidence, and to withdraw from arguments or turmoil, as any discord reflects quickly through your nervous system.  You cannot stand pressure and desire to work where there is no confusion.  This name restricts proper verbal expression; as a result, you are often lonely, craving understanding of others.  Yours is a very deep, reflective nature, but others would never know it as you keep your deeper feelings within."
" However, you have a generous side to your nature as well, and like to share what you have with others.  You have an empathy for the problems of others, particularly on social or economic issues, and you would gain satisfaction doing work of a humanitarian nature.  You have a clever mind and must have an interest outside the home to be happy.  Because of your interest in business and the affairs of the world, you find it easy to converse with all types of people.  There is a tendency for you to possess and control those closest to you, and, as a result, you would suffer with shattered ideals and losses in the affections.  Your feelings are very strong and you have difficulty in controlling your temper.  You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods."
" Being perceptive and intuitive, you often respond to your hunches, which can lead you into bitter experiences.  You love change, travel, and new opportunities and dislike monotonous detail.  Though you show enthusiasm over a new-found interest, you seldom finish the things you start.  If you are repressed or restricted in any way, you become frustrated, moody, and depressed.  You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" It is easy for you to express love and affection, but you would have to watch that your emotional nature does not get the better of you and lead you to indiscretions which you would later regret."
" You are inclined to do to excess the things you like to do.  You have very intense feelings and find it difficult to maintain stability and happiness.  If you allowed it, temper and self-pity could be problems."
" You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed over any real or imagined slight.  You feel and sense much more than you can fully understand, and could become psychic if you delved into the occult.  The problem then would be controllable thoughts, feelings, and reactions.  You find it difficult to be patient, practical, and systematic, preferring to act impulsively as the spirit moves you."
" You can find it difficult to express your deeper thoughts and feelings verbally.  It is much more natural for you to express your deeper thoughts in writing.  A lack of positivity and confidence is a source of difficulty in making decisions in business dealings.  You are easily offended, and can suffer with moods of depression.  You want the best, but lack the confidence and aggressiveness to materialize your desires.  Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
" However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
 Though reserved in showing affection you are a considerate person.
" You find pleasure in literature, in poetry, and in your ideals and will turn to them when you feel you have been misunderstood.  You are deeply moved by the beauties of life, especially nature.  Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next.  Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" You enjoy music and art, and love to meet and mix with people.  An appreciation for quality has prompted you to strive for the best standard in dress, material possessions, and choice of food.  On occasion, you can be intolerant and critical of others, quick to argue and to dominate situations.  Though the name offers a fair degree of balance, you would have to watch that strong appetites do not find an outlet through excessive eating, causing overweight and resultant problems, or through emotional experiences which could create unsettled conditions in your personal life."
 This name has not allowed you to be spontaneous and responsive; you like to have time to think and plan your actions.  You tend to be dominated by lyour habits and dislike changing a pattern of living that is comfortable to you.  You have a traditional and conservative outlook in almost everything.
" At times you feel torn between your desire for system and order, and your need for change and new experiences.  You do not accept new ideas readily and do not appreciate unsolicited advice.  You tend to be impulsive and could attract accidents as a result."
" It frustrates the expression of your softer, feminine qualities in that you find it difficult to express the depth of your feelings for those you love.  It limits you to practical matters of the day, filling your life with detailed routine. hard work, and monotony."
" You never seem to be out of your depth of understanding.  For these reasons others who may not have the same quickness of mind classify you as a ""know it all"" and, although you may be highly respected, this characteristic is unlikely to endear you to your associates.  You have a very responsible nature, are capable and mature, and are willing to assume a position as a pillar of the community."
" There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines."
" You are strongly independent and would be happiest when working without supervision, preferably in your own business where you have the challenge of ""standing or falling"" by your own decisions.  A good material standard of living is of utmost importance to you and you are careful to select only the best quality in all your purchases.  You enjoy the responsibility of home and family, and you appreciate a settled environment.  You may fail, however, to express the little gestures of affection and appreciation that would mean so much to those close to you."
" You can be a spontaneous, expressive, and talkative person.  Generally you are good-natured, though at times you can be rather blunt and sarcastic.  This name incorporates creative, artistic, and musical abilities, and there would be an element of originality in all that you do.  You like to do things on the spur of the moment without planning or prior arrangements.  Your spirits are buoyed up greatly by encouragement and appreciation.  There is a tendency to be scattering in your efforts and you prefer to avoid menial jobs of a routine and repetitive nature.  You are inclined to pursue good times and emotional indulgences to excess."
" When asked, you are able to give others good advice that you would probably not follow yourself, but must guard against being too opinionated in controversial matters."
" Though you show enthusiasm over a new-found interest, you seldom finish the things you start.  If you are repressed or restricted in any way, you become frustrated, moody, and depressed.  You often speak directly and can be cutting and sarcastic.  You experience many disappointments with people, for you trust others and take them at their word, only to be let down.  In time, you could become cynical and extremely critical towards people."
" You have the ability to organize and see the whole picture where any prospective business venture is concerned.  It is a name, however, which almost destroys the finer, sensitive qualities that should be expressed.  It makes spontaneous, natural expression difficult.  Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs."
 Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs. 
" As long as you have a sense of freedom from monotony and drudgery, and can see progress being made, you feel buoyant and optimistic.  However, obstacles and frustration can give rise to feelings of impatience, intolerance, and depression.  The ever-present desire to progress does not allow you proper relaxation or the proper expression of the softer feminine qualities of sympathy, encouragement, and affection.  Others may see you as rather shrewd and calculating."
" You resent obstacles, delays, and restrictions. This name gives you ambition, high ideals, and much creative ability, but the intense dynamic nature is too often spent in feelings and in moods, rather than in constructive action.  You desire to be your own boss, yet you find it difficult to stabilize your life and to settle down and be accumulative.  Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.  You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" In fact, others find it challenging to understand you as you do not reveal your innermost thoughts unless you are completely comfortable in your friendships.  For that reason, despite having good business abilities, you like to work alone or where you are making your own decisions.  It has created separateness from others and loneliness in your life."
"You are fond of sweets and rich foods and your tendency to eat heavily, causes overweight.  You could be subject to skin disorders, swelling of the legs and ankles, fluid function disorders or weakness affecting the back."
" When things are going well, you have a generous, magnanimous nature, ready to offer support and assistance to others.  When under stress, you can become overbearing and belittling in your attitude to others, and inclined to express sarcasm and temper.  Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own world of personal relationships or material possessions, you could suffer disappointments with those close to you, unfulfilled ideals, or material losses."
" You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence."
" At times, you find it easier to express your thoughts in writing, rather than verbally.  You are astute regarding the value of money, have good business judgment, and can drive a hard bargain if such is required. This name has not allowed you to express fully the softer, more spontaneous qualities of your nature because of its practical business attributes.  You are matter-of-fact in your attitude to things, not easily swayed by others, nor overly compassionate to the suffering of others.  You are an ambitious person, have expensive tastes, appreciate quality in all things, and desire to have the best money can buy.  You are inclined to judge things according to their material value."
" You want to be successful financially and have an interest in investments and stocks.  Being consistent and stable in your nature, you are decisive, capable, and efficient, though not always tactful in expressing your opinions.  Your appreciation of art and music is focused around how to make these activities into viable financial opportunities.  At times, you create misunderstandings with others as it is not easy for you to be diplomatic."
" You have many friends, but lose interest in people very quickly.  Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.  Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.  Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences."
" There is a tendency for you to dominate others.  You are too certain of yourself, and you are not open to the views of others or responsive to their desires or needs.  Also, this name does not incorporate qualities that enable you to be diplomatic and to compromise.  In all your work and activities you are inclined to be rather unsystematic and disorderly.  These characteristics spoil stability, progress, and accumulation, even though you may put forth intense effort.  Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life."
" Generally you are good-natured, though at times you can be rather blunt and sarcastic.  This name incorporates creative, artistic, and musical abilities, and there would be an element of originality in all that you do.  You like to do things on the spur of the moment without planning or prior arrangements.  Your spirits are buoyed up greatly by encouragement and appreciation.  There is a tendency to be scattering in your efforts and you prefer to avoid menial jobs of a routine and repetitive nature.  You are inclined to pursue good times and emotional indulgences to excess."
" You have a strong humanitarian nature and many times you are called upon to assist others with their problems.  Your desire to help sometimes is not appreciated, however, because they feel you are interfering.  You are fond of home and children and desire a settled environment.  You have an appreciation for music and art, and could express along these lines."
" While you have an appreciation for the finer things of life and could be successful along inspirational as well as business or professional lines of endeavour, there is a tendency to become involved in the needs and interests of others to the detriment of your own progress.  Home and family are important to you and you desire to establish a settled home environment where you can enjoy the congenial companionship of friends and family."
 There is a tendency to be scattering in your efforts and you prefer to avoid menial jobs of a routine and repetitive nature.  You are inclined to pursue good times and emotional indulgences to excess.
"Weaknesses in health due to the influence of this name centre in the head.  You could experience headaches, or difficulties with your teeth, ears, eyes, or sinuses.  Disorders related to the liver, which would be aggravated by rich foods, could also arise."
" You are strong willed and self-sufficient, not depending on others for encouragement.  Your desire for independence and freedom means that you seldom tolerate limitations.  Although you are naturally happy and generous, you fail to hold friendships because you are inclined to be too dogmatic, argumentative, or sarcastic.  In an argument, you usually emerge the victor, but at a cost."
" Your expression is invariably quite direct and candid, and lacks the moderating tone of tact, diplomacy, and friendliness.  Others find it difficult to accept your domineering and, at times, argumentative manner.  Your circle of friends is restricted to those of like nature.  Once friendship is established, you are very loyal and steadfast and do not tolerate gossip or criticism.  In your close associations and family life, there is little demonstration of sentiment, appreciation, sympathy, or encouragement.  It is difficult for you to find the right words for such circumstances."
" You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" While you can be exacting and thorough in whatever you decide to undertake, and desire to keep a well-ordered life with everything in its place, it is not easy for you to maintain the system and order you would like.  There is conflict between your desires and your expression which does not allow scope for your capabilities.  This lack of fulfilment of your deeper qualities tends to create repression and frustration."
" You work best in an independent capacity, where you are able to think problems out carefully before you act.  Your sensitivity and reserve prevent people from coming close in friendship.  There is always an aloofness and reserve that acts as a barrier and prevents any close ties. You live much within your own thoughts, and seek relaxation away from people, out in nature, where you can ease the tensions of your life.  You find it difficult to express your true feelings, whether it be affection, appreciation, or tenderness, which play such an important part in creating a close bond within the family."
" You do your best work when there is no disruption, as you do not easily adjust to interference and changes once you start a project; also you like to work step by step at your own speed.  Your infinite patience would allow you to develop intricate, involved skills to perfection.  However, it is not easy for others to work and live with you as you deliberate so long in arriving at conclusions and allow small details to restrict your point of view.  You often feel burdened with work, and worry abut details out of proportion to their importance.  This name has not allowed you to be spontaneous and responsive; you like to have time to think and plan your actions.  You tend to be dominated by lyour habits and dislike changing a pattern of living that is comfortable to you.  You have a traditional and conservative outlook in almost everything."
"This name creates weaknesses in the fluids of the body, kidneys, or glandular system."
" You are clever in mathematics and have great patience with work of a detailed nature, such as bookkeeping or accounting.  Systematic and practical in all you do, you enjoy the feeling of accomplishment from working diligently at a task.  You budget your personal finances very carefully.  Particular about your material possessions, you keep everything you own in a good state of repair.  This name limits imagination, flexibility, responsiveness, and spontaneity in your nature.  It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures."
 This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association.
" You enjoy all the finer things in life that a good standard of living allows.  You have good business judgment and would do well in a managerial position, as you have executive ability.  You work best in an independent capacity, where you are able to think problems out carefully before you act.  Your sensitivity and reserve prevent people from coming close in friendship.  There is always an aloofness and reserve that acts as a barrier and prevents any close ties. You live much within your own thoughts, and seek relaxation away from people, out in nature, where you can ease the tensions of your life.  You find it difficult to express your true feelings, whether it be affection, appreciation, or tenderness, which play such an important part in creating a close bond within the family."
"  As you are naturally talkative, you find it easy to meet and make friends with many people.  This name inclines you to be sympathetic and generous to those in difficult or unfortunate circumstances.  You can be firm, positive, and independent in your own ideas and in reaching your own decisions, yet when it comes to taking action or following things through to completion, you often need encouragement.  You respond quickly to kind words or any appreciation shown you.  There are artistic, creative abilities in this name that you could express through music or singing, or, in a practical way, through sewing or interior decorating.  You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature.  In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly.  You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine.  Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success."
 Hence there is a restriction in friendships and business opportunities.
" This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  You can be a stickler for detail, and very fussy and particular.  As spontaneous verbal expression can be difficult for you, you often feel awkward and embarrassed in situations requiring tact and diplomacy."
" You find it difficult to be patient, practical, and systematic, preferring to act impulsively as the spirit moves you."
" Your desire for peace and harmony causes you to withdraw from situations where there is friction and acrimony.  You are quite reserved and inclined to feel sensitive and self-conscious, even though you strive to appear poised and confident.  Being rather secretive in many ways, and not liking people to pry into your affairs restrict opportunities for friendship; not until you feel you can trust others do you open up to them.  The desire to help others and the generous side of your nature attract those who take advantage of you.  You lack the necessary aggressiveness for business success.  While you lack verbal expression and spontaneity under this name, you have a natural literary ability and writing comes easily to you.  You also have a deep appreciation of nature and all the finer things in life."
" You make friends easily but must guard against becoming involved in the affairs of others or being too easily led.  You could do well working with the public giving advice, where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.  You find it difficult to make snap decisions and to occupy a leadership position as you lack self-confidence.  You dislike heavy manual work; as well, you are inclined to put plans off until forced to take action.  You find it difficult to be systematic in business and you dislike budgeting.  Without the encouragement of others, you lack the energy, confidence, or initiative required to bring an idea to fruition."
" Others learn that you cannot be told what to do and you seldom change your mind once it is made up.  You prefer situations that allow a degree of independence, but are reluctant to take on a demanding work-load or responsibility.  In a position dealing with the public, you could do well because of your friendly personality, interest in people, and desire to please.  When asked, you are able to give others good advice that you would probably not follow yourself, but must guard against being too opinionated in controversial matters."
" You have big ideals and dreams about the things you would like but you are not always willing to put forth the necessary effort, particularly if it means being subservient to others or having to work in an unimportant, menial capacity.  Position and means are important to you and, in order to create this impression of affluence, you will spend even when it is not prudent to do so.  You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.  You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.  You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited."
"This name could affect your health through the kidneys, lower back, female trouble, poor circulation, or over-stoutness."
" You plan ahead giving careful consideration to detail.  Your home and family are important to you.  You have the ability to be an excellent homemaker and mother, or a teacher, as you appreciate people and know how to make them feel at ease, but you are inclined to worry over your responsibilities.  You enjoy a daily routine and settled conditions, once you have found a comfortable niche in life.  You resist changes until you have examined an idea in detail and until all facts fall into place.  If you have to make a change, it is not easy to do so happily.  You do not readily change your ideas unless you are thoroughly convinced that you must."
"A lack of confidence leads to procrastination, a need for support and encouragement from others, and a vulnerability to be taken advantage of in many situations."
" You have, also, a flair for creative expression with your hands.  You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing much turmoil and unhappiness.  Finding it difficult to join in conversation with those with whom you are not well-acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative with new acquaintances or in a large crowd.  As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly.  You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you.  One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire."
"You enjoy sweet, rich foods, as well as meat and starches, and any indulgence would create skin disorders or possible intestinal trouble.
"
" You have a very talkative nature and because of it, you could do well in saleswork or in a position where you handle the public.  However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
" Although you are attracted to technical, mechanical, scientific fields, you lack the patience to follow through with this interest.  This name gives a certain amount of practicality to your thinking; but there is also a tendency to scatter your efforts for, although you want system and order and stability in your life, you are too apt to be distracted from the job you are doing and to become involved in spontaneous interests.  You are good-natured, have a good sense of humour, and are fairly easy-going, making friends with those who enjoy a good time.  A weakness of this name is a tendency to make promises which you have difficulty in keeping.  You tend to be lavish in your tastes and to spend your money freely.  You have a heart of gold and are always ready to give generously."
 Others impose on your generosity at times.
" With supportive influence from other names you may use, you could be creative or artistic in a practical way, but basically this name is a plodding influence, though you have a desire for greater expression.  Although you desire to avoid monotony, you seem to be attuned to system, order, and attention to detail.  You can be very analytical, exacting, and patient as long as there is a challenge holding your interest, such as in the field of computers with its technical challenge.  When your interest is exhausted, you switch to something else even though it means leaving your undertakings unfinished.  This name makes you inquisitive and scientific in your approach to life, requiring everything to be proved to satisfy your skepticism.  This skepticism has not protected you from many disappointments when people you have trusted have let you down."
" You are ever on the watch for ways and means of making some ""easy money"" because this name destroys initiative and ambition, producing an easy-going, come-what-may nature which attaches value to money only for the self-enjoyment it can offer.  Misunderstandings could exist in your personal life because of this emotional power which you have difficulty controlling and also because of a difficulty in accepting a responsibility and seeing it through.  You are apt to leave a project unfinished and go on to something else.  Routine and system are foreign to your life, and, of course, these assets are an integral part of any successful undertaking."
" You desire to direct and control finances, both in business and in the home.  You would appreciate the cultural aspects of life such as art and music.  It tends to be too practical an influence causing you to put the practical needs of your home and family ahead of taking the time for the little considerations which create love and understanding.  This name creates a strong, capable nature, able to lead and control, of which you are probably well aware, but it causes a worrying nature.  It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
" You are usually either telling or showing someone how to do something properly.  Although you are good-natured and never intend offence, still your blunt, direct, and candid manner of expression strains friendships; your honesty and sincerity earn respect from others.  You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others."
" Conditions in your personal life can change very quickly to turmoil any time you are challenged, or when there is any friction or misunderstanding, because you can be  very caustic and outspoken.  There is an element of idealism in this name which makes you generous toward those who are less fortunate than yourself, and also causes you to uphold the rights of others.  This name creates an over-sensitive nature that allows your emotions to be unduly aroused."
Any weakness in health relative to this name would show in problems in the female generative organs.
" Your emotional nature at times does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, and you experience entanglements that could prove awkward and embarrassing."
" However, obstacles and frustration can give rise to feelings of impatience, intolerance, and depression.  The ever-present desire to progress does not allow you proper relaxation or the proper expression of the softer feminine qualities of sympathy, encouragement, and affection.  Others may see you as rather shrewd and calculating."
" You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" Your interests and hobbies are generally along practical, technical, or scientific lines."
 You would like to be easy-going and spontaneous but it does not come easily.  You can express yourself better through writing than verbally.  The mysteries of life appeal to you in your search for an understanding of the greater picture of life.  You love to read and can develop great powers of concentration.
" You are seldom satisfied and are always seeking something new.  However, you do not know the meaning of relaxation, for when supposedly resting, your mind is forever active, planning out some new project or seeking new ways to improve your present enterprise.  You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself."
" Then you can be quietly stubborn and resist taking advice.  You want to be more expressive, diplomatic, and easy-going, but you feel the limitation in your communication with others and it creates frustration within you."
" At times, you create misunderstandings with others as it is not easy for you to be diplomatic."
" In the home you assume your responsibilities capably, having the self-confidence to form your own opinions and make your own decisions.  Others can rely on you; once you have given your word you will do your utmost to fulfil a responsibility.  However, there is a tendency to be a little too independent in your thinking and it is difficult for you to accept the help of others when you should."
" You seem positive and decisive and can be outspoken in the expression of your opinions, but you lack the self-confidence needed to follow through with your ideas and plans.  Procrastination is your downfall.  You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.  It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.  This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition."
" You could have musical or artistic talents but find it difficult to concentrate your efforts in one area long enough to accomplish anything.  Spontaneous, happy-go-lucky, and expressive yourself, you like to see people happy and go out of your way to create harmony amongst them.  You find it difficult to discipline your desires and emotional feelings.  Too idealistic and impractical through the use of this name, you would not find it easy to make a success in the business world.  You are inclined to procrastinate and let things slide and to make promises that you find difficult to fulfil although you have the best of intentions."
 A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations.
" Though you recognize your responsibilities, you are inclined to put things off until you are forced to take action.  If given the opportunity, you could develop musical and artistic abilities."
" The ever-present desire to progress does not allow you proper relaxation or the proper expression of the softer feminine qualities of sympathy, encouragement, and affection.  Others may see you as rather shrewd and calculating."
"  This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
 You find it difficult to tolerate circumstances that are not up to your particular standards.
" Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
" You are very idealistic.  You have imagination and many ideas but lack the ambition and drive necessary to accomplish your undertakings.  Many times you dream about the things you desire in life, but when it comes down to putting forth the necessary effort and accomplishing your goals, you do not have the strength and initiative.  This name does not allow you the system and order your life requires to run in a smooth, efficient way, and if possible you will avoid having to make decisions because you feel much more secure when you can lean on others.  Many times you make promises you do not keep, although your intentions are always good."
"There is a weakness in the fluid functions and in the region of the head resulting in sinus problems, headaches, eye, ear, or throat conditions and related ailments.  Hair loss could also be a problem.
"
"Weaknesses in the health arising from the use of this name affect the respiratory organs, and the nervous system."
" You have the ability to express your thoughts and ideas, and you are friendly, likeable, and generous.  You enjoy fun, laughter and congenial association.  This name also gives you an appreciation of art, music, drama, or any of the many forms of expression in the arts.  Since you are quick and fluent in your expression, you have to guard against boastfulness or dominating a situation."
 Your feelings are very strong and you have difficulty in controlling your temper.  You must fight to overcome an inclination to indulge in the pleasures of life.  You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods.
" You are never satisfied with conditions, because your feelings and desires are so changeable.  Hence you seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.  There are people in your association who could influence you unfavourably and thereby mislead you; disillusionment, embarrassment, and bitter experiences then become your lot.  You have a very talkative nature and because of it, you could do well in saleswork or in a position where you handle the public.  However, you would find any position requiring self-confidence and aggressiveness very trying.  You are subject to moods of depression and self-pity, arising in part from a lack of confidence."
" Liking to plan and think ahead, you do not act impulsively and do not like to have your plans or routine interfered with. You seek the advice of others when making a decision and prefer to work for others, rather than carry the full responsibility yourself.  This name limits imagination and vision."
" You do not like to relinquish control nor do you accept advice readily.  You have a strong, determined nature and you must be careful that you do not dominate or interfere in the lives of others in your desire to be helpful.  This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of."
"Although mentally quick and intuitive in recognizing the thoughts and feelings of others, you experience a lack of fluency in verbal expression in responding. Kind but shy, you appear calm but suffer inwardly from nervous tension that saps your strength.  As a result, you experience moods of depression and self-pity and often avoid facing issues. A lack of confidence leads to procrastination, a need for support and encouragement from others, and a vulnerability to be taken advantage of in many situations."
" For that reason, despite having good business abilities, you like to work alone or where you are making your own decisions.  It has created separateness from others and loneliness in your life."
"The heavy responsibility your name creates can result in a worrying, intense nature.  It spoils the development and expression of your warmer, more feminine attributes.  It causes tension and allied problems in the female organs."
" If you have been given the opportunity, you could do well in business developing your leadership, administrative, and managing abilities.  Appreciating quality in all things, you desire to be prosperous.  You do not like to relinquish control nor do you accept advice readily.  You have a strong, determined nature and you must be careful that you do not dominate or interfere in the lives of others in your desire to be helpful.  This name makes you too forceful at times, limiting the natural feminine qualities of tenderness and tact."
" These contrasting natures make it difficult for people to understand you and can lead to friction in your personal life.  You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed and self-pitying over any real or imagined slight.  If you are not careful, people take advantage of your generous nature.  You find the beauties of nature, fine music, art, and literature--all the deeper things of life--inspiring.  The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding."
 Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life.
" There are times when you experience inner turbulence at your inability to say what you mean.  It is far easier for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings through writing than verbally.  You find pleasure in literature, in poetry, and in your ideals and will turn to them when you feel you have been misunderstood.  You are deeply moved by the beauties of life, especially nature.  Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next.  Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.  You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.  You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature."
" You are fond of surprises and are quick to respond to spontaneous invitations which promise a good time, particularly when they relieve you of a boring task.  Your dislike for monotony and routine, often means that you do not finish the things you start.  A natural rhythm, a sense of colour harmony, and creative ability contribute to a flair for composition and artistic and musical expression.  Expression comes easily to you; in fact, you should learn to control it and discipline your expression. You are not practical where money matters are concerned, your theory being that money is there to be spent.  You are kind and generous, and will fill a need when you see it; at times, others take advantage of your generosity. The most serious drawback of the influence of this name is in the strong emotional feelings that it produces, which are difficult to control and create lack of stability in your thinking or in your affairs."
" You are always ready to help those in less fortunate circumstances.  Your insistence on becoming involved in the affairs of others can cause them to regard you as interfering, even though you are only trying to help.  A weakness lies in the fact that you are deeply affected through your feeling for others and could suffer through worry and disturbed thoughts over matters that you can do nothing about.  While you have an appreciation for the finer things of life and could be successful along inspirational as well as business or professional lines of endeavour, there is a tendency to become involved in the needs and interests of others to the detriment of your own progress.  Home and family are important to you and you desire to establish a settled home environment where you can enjoy the congenial companionship of friends and family."
" You often feel burdened with work, and worry abut details out of proportion to their importance.  This name has not allowed you to be spontaneous and responsive; you like to have time to think and plan your actions.  You tend to be dominated by lyour habits and dislike changing a pattern of living that is comfortable to you.  You have a traditional and conservative outlook in almost everything."
" You place great importance on whatever you happen to be interested in, and can be quite thorough and detailed in what you are doing, but find it difficult to be consistent.  You scatter your efforts when things becomes too monotonous.  You have intense urges and feelings for which you can find no expression.  At times you are motivated more by moods and desires than by sound logic and reason, and under conditions of stress you could react inadvertently in temper or stubbornness that you would regret later."
" You seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates.   You find it difficult to systematize your efforts and to fulfil your obligations and plans as you are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job to reach your goals.  Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power.  This name has caused you to feel unsettled emotionally and mentally, being too easily influenced through your emotional nature and by other people.  The name makes it difficult for you to view life realistically, to be honest with yourself and with others.  Instead, you live in your desires, longing for conditions and people to be as you would like them to be."
" You desire to be in a position of leadership, for you can see where all the details fit into the overall situation and you have analytical and organizational ability.  You are seldom open to new ideas except those you can prove to yourself in a tangible way.  Imaginative, theoretical, or inspirational ideas are of little interest to you.  In close association you are not often attentive to the needs of others.  It is difficult for you to demonstrate tenderness and warmth and, consequently, personal relationships are not as harmonious as you wish them to be."
" You have an appreciation for the finer and deeper aspects of life.  Your scholarly, studious interests incline you to art, literature, philosophy, music, and drama.  You wonder about the deeper aspects of life contained in religious theories and occult beliefs.  Others may consider you to be aloof and unemotional since you often find it difficult to express spontaneously.  They could interpret your quietness as disinterest and aloofness, for they do not realize the depth of your feelings and thoughts.  You require time alone, especially in the outdoors, to cope with the pressures of life."
" Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative.  As a result, you seem aloof.  Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.  Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort."
" You enjoy reading and the beauties of nature, experiencing peace and relaxation in outdoor activities.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  With acquaintances and strangers, you tend to be reticent and reserved.  Your friends never know whether they will find you friendly and charming or lost in introspection.  When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" Able to see how the details of a situation fit into the overall picture, you have good judgment regarding anything of a practical or technical nature.  You are efficient, and capable of carrying a lot of responsibility, but your nature is so serious that personal association suffers.  You demand as much from others as you do from yourself.  It is difficult for you to merge your nature with others to create understanding, or to show love and tenderness to those close to you.  You experience much misunderstanding and unhappiness in your personal life as a result."
"Moods of depression, self-pity and a quick temper cause you much suffering.  Inner turbulence can deplete your vitality and have a detrimental effect on your health causing you to suffer through heart, lung, or respiratory troubles, as well as breakdowns of the nervous system."
Physical weaknesses arise from tension affecting the heart and respiratory organs.
"Your feelings and emotional desires are strong and consequently you are an individual, determined, strong-willed person.  Your creative nature and ambition drive you to pursue success to the extent that you jeopardize your personal well-being.  There is a tendency for you to dominate others.  You are too certain of yourself, and you are not open to the views of others or responsive to their desires or needs.  Also, this name does not incorporate qualities that enable you to be diplomatic and to compromise.  In all your work and activities you are inclined to be rather unsystematic and disorderly.  These characteristics spoil stability, progress, and accumulation, even though you may put forth intense effort.  Tension and frustration exact a heavy toll on your peace of mind and nervous system.  You are often preoccupied with the desires and demands of the moment.  Temper and indulgence could become serious problems in your life."
" Difficulty in expression results in your being too positive, blunt, and candid in speech.  Although you are easily offended by others, you do not show it.  You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof.  The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.  A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.  The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
"  You have a bubbling, spontaneous nature and a happy-go-lucky outlook which helps smooth the pathway of life.  Also you are sympathetic to the needs of others.  Interested in art, music, singing, dancing, and anything of an artistic nature, you could become a very fine performer. Your spontaneous expression stands you in good stead during arguments or debates, though you are perhaps too outspoken and inclined to sarcasm.  A very real weakness of this name is lack of system and order.  The use of this name makes it extremely difficult to carry through and finish the things you start.  It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.  You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous."
" Many times you dream about the things you desire in life, but when it comes down to putting forth the necessary effort and accomplishing your goals, you do not have the strength and initiative.  This name does not allow you the system and order your life requires to run in a smooth, efficient way, and if possible you will avoid having to make decisions because you feel much more secure when you can lean on others.  Many times you make promises you do not keep, although your intentions are always good."
"hard work, and monotony."
" The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness."
"Any weakness physically would be centred in the skin and liver, or in the head causing head colds, sinus conditions, headaches, or hay fever."
"Your emotional feelings are easily aroused and you will always be involved in other people's problems as a result of your overly sympathetic nature. You have many disappointments because of extending a helping hand to others in need, and then not receiving any acknowledgement or reciprocation for your generosity.  After each experience, you have to guard against feelings of despondency and self-pity. You have high goals and ideals, but must incorporate more practicality, system, and concentration in order to materialize them."
" These contrasting qualities make it difficult for people to understand you and can lead to friction in your personal life.  You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed over any real or imagined slight.  You feel and sense much more than you can fully understand, and could become psychic if you delved into the occult.  The problem then would be controllable thoughts, feelings, and reactions.  You find it difficult to be patient, practical, and systematic, preferring to act impulsively as the spirit moves you."
"As it is not easy for you to share your deeper thoughts and ideals with others, you are inclined to choose the association of those few friends with whom you feel the most at ease and with whom you can enjoy companionship in a contemplative mood without feeling pressure for verbal communication."
" You are apt to leave a project unfinished and go on to something else.  Routine and system are foreign to your life, and, of course, these assets are an integral part of any successful undertaking."
" You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself."
" While you could do well in certain positions of authority, you have a certain lack of initiative and a tendency to procrastinate.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work. However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements."
" You are easily offended, and can suffer with moods of depression.  You want the best, but lack the confidence and aggressiveness to materialize your desires.  Procrastination is a weakness, for so often you are inclined to avoid issues and to leave things undone until the last moment when you are forced to take action."
" Your friends never know whether they will find you friendly and charming or lost in introspection.  When unhappy or disappointed, you can be moody and temperamental, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.  You will go out of your way to help others, and find it difficult to say ""no"" and mean it.  Others impose on your generosity at times."
" You plan ahead, giving careful consideration to detail.  Because of your efficiency you attract a great deal of responsibility, and you are inclined to worry excessively and become too involved in details out of proportion to their importance.  You resist change until you have examined an idea in detail and all facts fall into place for you.  You can be deliberate to a fault.  Your over-cautious nature allows many promising opportunities to slip by.  Conserving finances and material possessions, you maintain your home at a good standard, and treat all family responsibility seriously.  Though reserved in showing affection you are a considerate person."
" While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues."
" You desire to be your own boss, yet you find it difficult to stabilize your life and to settle down and be accumulative.  Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.  You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.  Your home-life particularly would suffer.  This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better things in life such as art, music, and literature.  You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers which invariably makes a very favourable impression.  It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is very difficult to retain control."
" The intensity and consequent outbursts leave hurt feelings in their wake, usually involving those closest to you."
" You long for praise and appreciation for your efforts, but others find it difficult to understand you.  You dislike monotony and system and enjoy being creative in an inventive way whether it be in interior decorating, music, art, crafts, or other endeavours that require versatility and skill.  You are imaginative and visionary, somewhat of a perfectionist, yet the results of your efforts often fall short of your high expectations.  A leadership position appeals to you because you would enjoy directing others rather than being directed.  Your feelings are strong and you tend to react intensely to situations."
" Misunderstandings could exist in your personal life because of this emotional power which you have difficulty controlling and also because of a difficulty in accepting a responsibility and seeing it through.  You are apt to leave a project unfinished and go on to something else.  Routine and system are foreign to your life, and, of course, these assets are an integral part of any successful undertaking."
 Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures.
" Others are attracted by your generosity and your consideration of their interests.  Although this name is well balanced, if it is combined with a surname that is not harmonious, you would tend to worry and find it difficult to organize your efforts."
" Although you do not tolerate interference in your own affairs, this characteristic does not prevent you from interfering in the affairs of others.  You are usually either telling or showing someone how to do something properly.  Although you are good-natured and never intend offence, still your blunt, direct, and candid manner of expression strains friendships; your honesty and sincerity earn respect from others.  You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others."
"Weaknesses in your health affect the senses of the head, causing eye, ear or sinus trouble and the female organs."
 It also limits your sense of humour and any real empathy of the problems of others.  Those close to you do not appreciate that you may forget the thoughtful expressions of affection toward them.  Your very practical nature does not allow you the appreciation you might have for life's more aesthetic values as it keeps your mind mostly concerned with facts and figures.
" Patience is not your forte.  You do, however, have leadership ability and would never be happy in a subservient position.  You are ambitious and aggressive by nature.  You would be happiest in positions where you are free to express individually and creatively and where opportunities are not restricted; you desire freedom, and do not tolerate being possessed by others.  You appreciate change and travel, and the opportunity to meet and mix with others, and to influence them with your creative ideas.  You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses and bitter experiences.  This name also creates caustic expression and moods which prevent harmony and happiness in close association."
" Appreciating quality and knowing the value of money, you desire to be financially successful and to enjoy life's comforts.  You want to make money in easier ways than through arduous work."
 You have to be your own boss as it is most difficult for you to submit to direction from others.
 Your sensitivity and lack of verbal expression frustrate and limit the satisfaction in life to be gained from your responsible and capable nature.
" You have a keen business sense, knowing a lucrative proposition when it is presented, and it is likely others would come to you for business counsel.  You are a capable leader and organizer who should never be in a subordinate position.  You have the ability to organize and see the whole picture where any prospective business venture is concerned.  It is a name, however, which almost destroys the finer, sensitive qualities that should be expressed.  It makes spontaneous, natural expression difficult.  Any physical weaknesses relative to this name would show in the generative organs."
" Your ability to organize and direct the efforts of others enables you to excel in any managerial position because you have the ability to grasp the concept of a goal complete with an understanding of the steps to be taken.  This name has allowed you to develop depth and breadth of mind.  You are able to retain facts, to grasp new information to your existing store of knowledge.  You never seem to be out of your depth of understanding.  For these reasons others who may not have the same quickness of mind classify you as a ""know it all"" and, although you may be highly respected, this characteristic is unlikely to endear you to your associates.  You have a very responsible nature, are capable and mature, and are willing to assume a position as a pillar of the community."
" You are very creative and promotional, and work intensely to carry out your plans.  Though you have limitless enthusiasm for new ventures, you lose interest quickly once things become routine, as you dislike being forced to attend to detail and do monotonous work.  Your lack of patience and consistency in your affairs and your tendency to act impulsively can lead to actions you later regret taking, or to accidents, particularly to the head.  You find that you often do the hard, pioneering work in an undertaking, only to see others reap the benefits.  While this name makes you very honest and sincere in your personal relationships, your tendency to retaliate with caustic remarks over even slight offenses could spoil many friendships."
" It tends to be too practical an influence causing you to put the practical needs of your home and family ahead of taking the time for the little considerations which create love and understanding.  This name creates a strong, capable nature, able to lead and control, of which you are probably well aware, but it causes a worrying nature.  It makes it difficult for you to express some of the softer, spontaneous qualities that do so much for personal associations."
 You appreciate good food and may even be considered a connoisseur of fine foods.
" It gives you a creative ability in art, music, singing, or fancywork and an appreciation for refined surroundings.  Your sociable nature expresses affection, kindness, and thoughtfulness to the extent that it is difficult for you not to be affected by others and governed by your emotions, rather than by logic and reason.  As you respond to love and encouragement from others, your romantic and dreamy nature can easily lead you into love affairs.  Your desire for peace at any price can result in going out of your way to avoid arguments and confrontation or hurting the feelings of others.  Also, budgeting can be a problem as you enjoy spending money and can easily ignore being practical."
" Although you have many good plans, can visualize their workings, and have the best of intentions, planning is often as far as you get.  Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.  Your emotional nature at times does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, and you experience entanglements that could prove awkward and embarrassing."
" You resist being forced into change and could become almost impervious to new ideas.  You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood."
"Your desire for sweet, rich foods could cause overweight, circulatory problems, or weakness in the kidneys."
"An outdoor life also appeals to you and you could find much enjoyment in the beauties of nature.  In the business world, your reserve and outward placidity command respect for your authority.  However, in your personal life, this reserve and reticence are often mistaken for coldness and lack of feeling, with the result that others find it difficult to understand you.  While your name gives you a clever, deep mind, you feel and sense much that you do not fully understand. As it is not easy for you to share your deeper thoughts and ideals with others, you are inclined to choose the association of those few friends with whom you feel the most at ease and with whom you can enjoy companionship in a contemplative mood without feeling pressure for verbal communication."
" You become intensely involved with everything you plan to do, but the stress arising from frustrating obstacles or misunderstandings with others could prompt you to be intolerant and sarcastic in your expression, with breakdowns in congenial relations with family and friends a possible end result."
